"I’m not sure what to say other than she was, is, and will be the best thing I have ever known. She is responsible for every good part of me, and she took me with her when she left."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>"If there is anything I can say to whoever is reading, it would be that absolutely nothing is promised. We really aren’t owed anything. Your life really can change in just a moment, so as my mom would say, do everything as if it your last time doing it," Eden went on to say. "Losing my mother has always been my greatest fear, as I’m sure many of you feel the same, and we have this habit as people of thinking that it will never happen to us. Unfortunately, it can, and sometimes it does."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the weeks after her mother's death, Eden has posted a few poems about death and definitely seems to be taking the loss very hard.
