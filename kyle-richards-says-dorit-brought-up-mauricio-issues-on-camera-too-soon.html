I feel like you could see that.”</p><p>In the clip, Kemsley, 47, inquired about Richards and her husband, <a href=#><strong>Mauricio Umansky</strong></a>. “Have you had any thoughts recently? Like, do you think you would not end up with Mau?” Kemsley asked, noting that Richards’ Instagram page made it seem like the couple were “spending a lot of time away from each other.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kyle-Richards-Says-Dorit-Kemsley-Brought-Up-Mauricio-Umansky-Issues-on-Camera-Before-She-Was-Ready-553.jpg><p>Richards replied, “I feel like I needed a little freedom — freedom and some space.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kyle-Richards-Says-Dorit-Kemsley-Brought-Up-Mauricio-Umansky-Issues-on-Camera-Before-She-Was-Ready-551.jpg><p>Season 13 of RHOBH, which premiered on Wednesday, October 25, will shine a light on Richards and Umansky’s rocky relationship. Us Weekly confirmed in July that the <a href=#>pair had separated</a> after 27 years of marriage. One day after their split made headlines, Richards and Umansky <a href=#>shared they’d had a “rough year”</a> of marriage in a joint Instagram statement.</p><p>As Richard prepares to relive the ups and downs as they air on television, she told cohosts <a href=#><strong>Kelly Ripa</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Mark Consuelos</strong></a> on Friday that she was a “little angry” and a “little bitter” while filming the new season.</p><p>The candid reaction to Kemsley’s line of questioning came days after Richards admitted she was “taken aback” by photos of Umansky holding hands with his <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> partner,<a href=#><strong> Emma Slater</strong></a>, while out to dinner in Beverly Hills on Sunday, October 22.</p><p>“That was <a href=#>very hard to see</a>,” Richards said during a Wednesday, October 25, appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. “That hurt my feelings.”</p><p>The Bravolebrity added: “I don’t know if anything’s happened yet, but obviously there’s something there. Listen, I love him very much and we are amicable, [but] that really did hurt me.”</p><p>One day later, Umansky took to social media to <a href=#>shut down rumors</a> that he and Slater, 34, are romantically involved.</p><p>“For full clarity, we are not dating,” he said in an Instagram Story video. “We’ve been dancing together now for six weeks, four hours a day every single day.”</p><p>He continued: “We went to a restaurant to go get some sushi right after rehearsal. It’s a very intense week, a very emotional week. We were talking about the week during the dinner and when we came out of dinner we were recapping, and I reached out to grab Emma’s hand. She grabbed my hand and then we walked to the cars, just recapping.”</p><p>Despite Umansky’s ongoing drama with Richards, he <a href=#>dedicated his Tuesday, October 24, DWTS performance</a> to his estranged wife. In accordance with the <a href=#>Most Memorable Year theme</a>, the real estate mogul picked 1996, the year he and Richards tied the knot.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Richards was four months pregnant with her and Umansky’s daughter Alexia when the pair walked down the aisle and was already the mother of daughter Farrah, 34, whom she shares with ex-husband <strong>Guraish Aldjufrie</strong>. The actress and Umansky went on to welcome daughters Sophia and Portia in 2000 and 2008, respectively.</p><p>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKypJViv6qvx5qpnatdqK66v4ydpquhpGKvs7vUoJ%2BtZaWleq6t1KugnKGfYra0v9SeqmannmKwornEq5hmrJ%2BkerS7zqdm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jimmy-garoppolo.html><span>←</span><span>Jimmy Garoppolo- Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Ethnicity</span></a>
