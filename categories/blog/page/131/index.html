The title and logline for Apple TV+’s Shrinking suggested the show, created by Bill Lawrence, Jason Segel, and Brett Goldstein, would center on a therapist (Segel’s Jimmy) dealing with grief as he upends the way he approaches his practice. And while Jimmy’s unorthodox, arguably unethical way of dealing with his patients drove much of this season’s humor, the overlapping bonds between its varied cast of characters turned out to be the true foundation of this workplace-family sitcom.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Marie Osmond Celebrates Her Daughter-in-Law Claire's Birthday with the Best Words</h2><time>Mar 22, 2024</time>

Bring the beat in!
Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can’t you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you’re near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Now everybody asks me why I’m smiling out from ear to ear
They say love hurts
But I know it’s gonna take a little work
Nothing’s perfect
But it’s worth it</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/130/>← Prev Page</a>
