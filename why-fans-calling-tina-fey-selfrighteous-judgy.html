She's more than just a comedian and actress, and she's done just about every job in the industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet some people are beginning to wonder whether Fey is really something special, or if she's been playing off a not-so-great personality with humor for way too long.</p><h2 id=some-say-tina-fey-is-39-glorified-39>Some Say Tina Fey Is 'Glorified'</h2><p>Looking at Tina Fey's career history, it's almost laughable to say she's "glorified," in terms of what she's accomplished. Yet some say that Tina is glorified in the sense that people think she's a feminist and a strong leader, but her behavior suggests the opposite.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Commenters</a> think that her comedy "has an air of self-righteousness," pointing to the fact that Fey constantly criticizes other women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A lot of it might be funny, sure, but fans think it's also harmful because of the impact Tina has on people in Hollywood and fans at home watching. It seems that maybe Tina hasn't come a long way since <a href=#>her self-proclaimed mean-girl days</a>.</p><h2 id=is-tina-fey-39-s-comedy-relatable>Is Tina Fey's Comedy Relatable?</h2><p>While some fans defended Tina by saying that male comedians do the same things as female ones, yet aren't subjected to the same scrutiny, others disagreed. In short, Tina Fey is attracting attention because "a lot of what she writes and says completely contradicts her supposed feminist values," say critics.</p><p>Not only is Tina Fey kind of still a mean girl, they suggest, but she appeals to her audience because of the views she claims to have, and then people ignore the potentially poor taste of her comedy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Tina Fey Can't Stand This A-List Celebrity And Fans Kind Of Understand Why</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's all subjective, of course, but some say that Tina Fey is really judgy and self-righteous and that she places herself far above other famous females in a way that's detrimental to her reputation and the comedic craft as a whole.</p><p>There's also the fact that <a href=#>she's recently angered Asian activists</a>...</p><p>Other people who have watched Tina's comedy but don't identify as "fans" agree that she's marketing herself as the "cool, quirky girl," but it's "slightly annoying" that she pushes the branding so hard. Especially when, they claim, she trashes other women's looks, which is a widely acknowledged no-no for any comedian these days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, Tina Fey has quite the following, including a lot of people who took to task the original poster who called her out for being self-righteous.</p><p>It's evident that Tina's fans will continue to support her for the positive things she's done for women in the media and in comedy, even if she doesn't always charm everyone.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Tina Fey Called This Reality Star "Awful" During Her 'SNL' Appearance</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdm66vv4ycmKWkmaO0bsDIp5hmnpWuerSxy5%2Bpop%2BYqbKwwdJmoa6cl658</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./black-history-month.html><span>←</span><span>The 6 Dates That You Should Know For Black History Month</span></a>
