<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>ATP Moselle Open Alexander Bublik vs Fabio Fognini: Preview, Head-To-Head, andPrediction</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>The ATP Moselle Open continues in France in full swing. The first round saw many capable players exiting, which means that the competition is high. Now, moving on to the round of 16, the tournament will only become more exciting. We will see the Russian, Alexander Bublik, fighting against the experienced Italian player,&nbsp;</span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>Fabio Fognini</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Both players are in very different positions in their careers. Fognini began his tennis life a decade before Bublik even came into the senior tour. Regardless of their experience, both players are in more or less similar territories at the moment, which will make their match a close one. Who has the potential edge over the other, then?</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong><span>Alexander Bublik vs Fabio Fognini: Preview</span></strong></h2><p><span>Bublik began his season with an early exit in the&nbsp;</span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>Australian Open</span></a><span>. He would go on to exit all slams before he could reach the final stages. Bublik found some momentum in&nbsp;</span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>Wimbledon</span></a><span>, but that stint ended in round four. He hasn’t fared any better in the ATP 1000 series. However, he has experienced some luck on the ATP 250 side.</span></p><p><span>He won the Halle Open in June and the European Open in October. Before the Moselle Open, Bublik played till round three in the&nbsp;</span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>Paris Masters</span></a><span>, which was his best result in the ATP 1000 series this year.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022-04-12T175752Z_2019020648_UP1EI4C1DWERK_RTRMADP_3_TENNIS-MONTECARLO.jpg><p><span>On the other hand, his Italian opponent is having a rough time. Fognini would also go on to exit the first slam in round 1 and in the </span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>French Open</span></a><span>, he would fight till round 3. But he was absent from the remainder of the two slams. He didn’t have a better Masters stint either, as he only managed to compete in three. Fognini mostly played challenger tournaments this year but didn’t find better results there as well.</span></p><p><span>Fogini experienced some success in Genoa, where he reached the final, but that would be his best result this year. Fognini would be unable to qualify for the Paris Masters prior to the tournament.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong><span>Bublik vs Fognini: Head-To-Head</span></strong></h2><p><span>Bublik and Fognini, despite being active for so long, have never faced each other on the ATP Tour. This will be a fresh bout for men’s tennis and for the audience in Metz as the Italian and the Russian player go head-to-head in an all-out battle to move on to the next round.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong><span>Predictions: Bublik to take the match in straight sets</span></strong></h2><p><span>Bublik’s performance this year has been much better and consistent than that of his Italian opponent. Looking at his two ATP 250 titles, one can tip the victory in Bublik’s favor as he steps into the stadium with his usual gusto. Fognini is in the twilight of his career and cannot play as well as he used to earlier. This bout will likely see a decisive victory by the former number 25.</span></p><p><strong><span>WATCH THIS STORY –</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Serena Williams’ Ex-coach Patrick Mouratoglou Launches Fresh Controversy as He Irks Rafael Nadal Fans With a Biased Novak Djokovic Statement</a></strong></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8Ctp2aslaO7qr%2BMp5ywq12WwbF5zKiqnqScmnqwvMSnZJqkla2ur7DEq2SbrZKhtqx51axkn5mSnrxuss6gpaKmmWK9s7HVopywZZiarqV506hkoZ2RmXqiusNmp6udlJ6wtbXOp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1213633-alex-reynolds-not-knocked-out-aew-dynamite.html><span>←</span><span>Alex Reynolds Says He Wasnt Knocked Out On AEW Dynamite, It Was Planned And It Was Handled Perfec</span></a>
