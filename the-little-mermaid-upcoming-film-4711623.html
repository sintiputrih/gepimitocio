Director <strong>Rob Marshall</strong> released a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>statement</a> in July 2019 about Halle after her casting was announced: “After an extensive search, it was abundantly clear that Halle possesses that rare combination of spirit, heart, youth, innocence, and substance — plus a glorious singing voice — all intrinsic qualities necessary to play this iconic role.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Halle Bailey on her new <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#LittleMermaid</a> role: "I don't pay attention to the negativity; I just feel like this role is something bigger than me" <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>https://t.co/pidgYYQ0lw</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/rmUxbFSuYY</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-18>— Variety (@Variety) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>August 7, 2019</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Halle opened up about her audition process in a May 2023 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Glamour</a>. “I was almost just paralyzed with fear,” Halle said, revealing that her sister <strong>Chloe Bailey</strong> helped her with the process. “We’d run it and we’d run it and we’d run it, over and over,” she said. Speaking about the moment she learned she got the part, Halle said, “I freaked out, I was screaming I was like, Is this real life? I was catapulted into this new world.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>Halle’s casting sparked some cruel online backlash over a Black actress playing the role, and the singer/actress broke her silence about playing Ariel in August 2019. “I feel like I’m dreaming and I’m just grateful and I don’t pay attention to the negativity,” Halle told Variety. “I just feel like this role was something bigger than me and greater and it’s going to be beautiful. I’m just so excited to be a part of it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>In an August 2022 interview with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a> for their annual Power of Young Hollywood issue, Halle revealed that she got words of wisdom from her grandparents when dealing with casting criticism. “<span class=s1>It was an inspiring and beautiful thing to hear their words of encouragement, telling me, ‘You don’t understand what this is doing for us, for our community, for all the little Black and brown girls who are going to see themselves in you,’” Halle said.</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Check out the new poster for Disney's <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#TheLittleMermaid</a> and see the official trailer debut during the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#Oscars</a> this Sunday on ABC! <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/u94dSqqfod</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-23>— Walt Disney Studios (@DisneyStudios) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>March 8, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-25>Halle again addressed the backlash towards her casting in an April 2023 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Weekly</a>. She noted that there’s “been a lot of different opinions and comments” about her role in the film. “I just have to block out the noise,” Halle said. “I don’t really see a lot of the comments. I choose to not read them, or delete Twitter, things like that, and just accept this moment for me what it is, which is a big, beautiful blessing and opportunity for me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-26>Halle has shared what it means to be the first Black actress to play Ariel. “I really hope that I put my own stamp on her character by showing more of her vulnerability,” Halle told Glamour. “I felt like I could relate to her growing up in a big family and having older sisters to guide you, and having a father that’s very protective and overbearing at times but loves so hard.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-27>When filming wrapped in July 2021, Halle posted a long message about how “grateful” she was to be a part of this movie.

I wanted to understand who he was and give him more of a backstory, understand what he wants in the world, understand what troubled him. I think ultimately what was special about that is in getting to know him better we got to know him and Ariel’s relationship better.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-39><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Melissa McCarthy</strong></a> will play Ursula, the evil sea witch. Melissa rose to fame on Gilmore Girls and earned Oscar nominations for Can You Ever Forgive Me? and Bridesmaids. “I play Ursula, the sea witch. It is so fun, we’re just in rehearsals.

Rob had nothing but praise for Halle as soon as he saw her audition. “<span class=s1>Halle had this incredible facility to be able to dig deep, find the truth of Ariel’s passion and her heart,” he told Variety. “It was like watching a great film actor being born.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-47>Rob is also producing the film with <strong>John DeLuca</strong>, <strong>Marc Platt</strong>, and<strong> Lin-Manuel Miranda</strong>.

The screenplay was penned by <strong>Jane Goldman</strong> and <strong>David Magee</strong>.</p><h2>Will There Be Changes From The Original?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-48>The new Little Mermaid is loosely based on the <strong>Hans Christian Andersen</strong> fairy tale of the same name. The movie is a remake of the animated Disney classic which follows Ariel, a mermaid princess who strikes a deal with a sea witch to become human so she can be with the human prince she’s fallen in love with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Little-Mermaid-shutter-embed-6.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-49>Many of your favorite Little Mermaid songs from the original movie will be a part of the remake. Halle admitted during an Oscars pre-show that “Part of Your World” was her “number one” song.</p><p id=content-paragraph-50>Rob revealed that the live-action version of “Part of Your World” won’t be an exact recreation of the original. <span class=s1>“[Halle] sings that moment up an octave from the original,” Rob revealed to Variety. “It’s the most chilling, and the most thrilling, film moment because it crystallizes not just her incredible vocal ability but the emotional passion she has in singing it.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-51>The director also noted that Halle’s Ariel will have red hair. Halle will have her signature locs with some looser tresses.<span class=s1> “She looks stunning in red hair; not everybody does,” he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-52>However, <strong>Lin-Manuel Miranda</strong> and<strong> Alan Menken</strong> are teaming up to also write new songs for the film’s soundtrack. “I actually didn’t write any new songs for Sebastian the Crab because I love his songs so much. I was like, ‘I can’t. Nope, not me. I can’t do it.’ I did get to write for some of the other characters in that movie. Every song you love in The Little Mermaid is still in The Little Mermaid, we just found some new moments to musicalize,” Lin-Manuel told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Collider</a>.</p><h2>Production Trivia</h2><p id=content-paragraph-53>Director Rob Marshall made his feature directorial debut with Chicago in 2002. He’s no stranger to the Disney universe.
