She told Us that learning to “bounce ideas off somebody” was something&nbsp;she’s&nbsp;had to work on with him.</p><p class=p1>“I’m used to being the boss of everything, especially when it comes to design. So it’s just like this is a whole new dynamic for us and it’s gonna be interesting how it plays out,” she said, with a laugh.</p><p class=p1>“Bickering on camera is not necessarily full reality,” she added. “It’s like a character. So, there’s just so much conversation and dynamics and things that have to be talked about on and off-camera. I mean, it is challenging to work with your spouse, especially if they’re not used to being on TV.”</p><p class=p1>Joshua first joined&nbsp;Christina&nbsp;in her series&nbsp;Christina&nbsp;in the Country, which followed her as she expanded her home renovation business in Tennessee. He will appear on the new season of&nbsp;Christina&nbsp;on the Coast, which premieres&nbsp;Thursday, July 11 on HGTV and Max.</p><p class=p1>“You see him pop up in here and there, but he doesn’t take [on] a big role,” she clarified. “So, he is more involved when we’re flipping houses in Tennessee.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Christina-Hall-opened-up-about-the-ups-and-downs-of-working-with-her-husband-Joshua-Hall-1.jpg><p class=p1>And they’re on-screen dynamic will be more in focus than ever when they team up against Christina’s ex-husband <strong>Tarek El Moussa</strong> and his wife, <strong>Heather Rae El Moussa</strong>, in the upcoming HGTV competition show The Flip Off where the two couples will go head-to-head to see “who can find, buy, renovate, and flip a house for the biggest financial gain, and the chance at bragging rights.”</p><p class=p1>Christina&nbsp;told Us that they “just started filming” the new show, which is slated to premiere next year. “We actually haven’t filmed together with Tarek and Heather yet, so I can’t really say that I know what that looks like,” she shared. “Only Josh and I have filmed together so far.”</p><p class=p1>Christina&nbsp;and Tarek, 42, famously cohosted HGTV’s Flip or Flop together for 10 years and share kids Taylor, 13, and Brayden, 8. They split after seven years of marriage in 2016 and finalized their divorce in 2018. Tarek went on to wed Heather, 36, in 2021 and the two welcomed their son Tristan in January 2023. (Christina&nbsp;also shares her youngest son, Hudson, with her ex-husband <strong>Ant Anstead,</strong> whom she was married to from 2018 to 2021.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>For now,&nbsp;Christina&nbsp;is excited to share new episodes of&nbsp;Christina&nbsp;on the Coast with viewers. “I really wanted to do big projects and luckily we got some really big ones, [taking]entire homes down to the studs, really touching the entire part of a lot of these houses, long remodels that took a year,” she teased of the new episodes. “So I think fans are really gonna&nbsp; like just seeing an entire project come together.”</p><p>Christina on the Coast season 5 premieres on HGTV and Max on Thursday, July 11, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Andrea Simpson</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahn6SrwG6vx6ugrKyZo65utMClo2aZlKK2tb%2BMoqusZZ6aw6a%2BjJ6YrLFdqbxuw86romavmam1bq2MrKeoraOafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anatomy-of-a-fall-parents-guide-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Anatomy of a Fall parents guide explained</span></a>
