Rachael, 43, is a former model and ran her own successful events company Strawberry Promotions from the age of 19 up until 2006. The happy couple met in 2002 at a cricket ground in Birmingham while Rachael was promoting her business. Three years later, the pair tied the knot and the rest, they say, is history!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bd8a17edb4f9-freddie-wife-z.jpg><p id=e5O4WQPQJBhp style=text-align:center data-wc=9><strong>The pair met in 2002 and married in 2005</strong></p><p id=eVoeRqXJVFd- data-wc=54>The TV star has been open in recent years about his battle with depression, and even revealed his wife's reaction to his diagnosis. During his appearance on the Australian version of in 2015, the former cricketer said: "I think in some ways she was quite relieved.&nbsp;</p><p id=ejNDl094JEsH data-wc=49><strong>"I think it's because she saw me as vulnerable as well.</strong> I spent a lot of time putting up a barrier playing sport and you tend to play up to that character all of the time, and in the end it got exhausting. I couldn't do it any longer."</p><h2>Freddie Flintoff's children</h2><p id=eNvIevRKugxd data-wc=68><strong>Freddie and Rachael have four children together.</strong> Their first baby was a daughter, Holly, born in 2004. Shortly after they welcomed Corey, and then another son, Rocky, in 2008. In April 2020, the pair then announced that they had welcomed their fourth child, another boy, the previous Christmas. Freddie even revealed that they named their youngest Preston in tribute to the Lancashire city that Freddie grew up in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2968b4e9fa3a-freddie-flintoff-wife-z.jpg><p id=ePljU2p3xGRM style=text-align:center data-wc=12><strong>Freddie Flintoff and wife Rachael welcomed their fourth son in December 2019</strong></p><p id=eyUVGBFs46A7 data-wc=56>At the time he told talkSPORT: <strong>"Little Preston was born at Christmas - it is the first time I've actually spoken about it.</strong> But yeah, we have got another baby and it has been nice spending time with him."<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Freddie first announced his wife's pregnancy in October after Rachael revealed her bump at the Attitude Awards.</p><p id=eK9OD9la7m7W data-wc=64>The couple's baby may have come as a welcomed surprise after the host previously admitted that he didn't think he and Rachael would have any more children after welcoming Rocky. In 2016, he told The Sun:<strong>&nbsp;"We thought about it.</strong> I originally wanted five but you have three and that felt like enough. I couldn't go back to the nappy stage now."</p><h2>What has Freddie Flintoff said about his family in the past?</h2><p id=eYIemGkzJ6sS data-wc=81>Freddie usually likes to keep his family life away from the spotlight, however <strong>the former England Cricketer did reveal that becoming a father made him a better sportsman.</strong> Just one year after his daughter Holly was born in 2004, Freddie made history with the 2005 Ashes victory over Australia. "My career at the time, I started doing really well," he told the First Time Dads podcast. "Everyone said that couldn't happen, but it put everything into perspective. I actually got better."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e6C3AxoW7_9I style=text-align:center data-wc=7><strong>Freddie with his cricket club, aged 11</strong></p><p id=eTh6loeLtMEq data-wc=53>He added: "You start thinking, 'You know what? I'm dressed in whites, we're chucking a ball around and trying to hit it.' <strong>Although it WAS the most important thing, it now isn't.&nbsp;</strong>It frees you up, especially with batting. I started scoring a lot of runs because I wasn't bothered about getting out."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dnyRamppZ5ansqWwyJ5kn6SZo8GwssVmrqKelWKur7CMn5imoZyufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./every-yellowstone-star-returning-for-season-5.html><span>←</span><span>Every Yellowstone star returning for season 5</span></a>
