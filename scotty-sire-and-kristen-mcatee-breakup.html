They had what appeared to be the perfect relationship.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"We broke up" details the reasons leading to Scotty and Kristen's breakup.</h2><p>"I feel like we were in our relationship because it was comfortable, and obviously we love each other and [...] care about each other," Scotty said at the beginning of the video.&nbsp;</p><p>"We both agree that this is the right decision for us, it's difficult, but we know it's the right thing," he went on to add.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"We got to a point where, like you were saying, we've been together for so long, and it was comfortable, and I think it just got to a point where we grew apart, we weren't together anymore,"&nbsp;Kristen agreed.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're going to go our own way and try to grow individually. During our relationship you shaped who I am now today, we've changed each other's lives, I think for the better, and I think that this is going to be another good, new chapter of our lives,"&nbsp;Scotty rounded up the video.&nbsp;</p><p>"That's the end of our relationship, thank you guys for watching.
