During the episode, viewers learned that the doctor left Seattle and reunited with his old love interest. Alex and Izzie were raising twin daughters on a horse farm in Kansas — information he revealed to Jo and <a href=#>longtime friend Meredith</a> (<a href=#><strong>Ellen Pompeo</strong></a>) in a series of letters.</p><p>Viewers were taken aback by the plot point, but not entirely disappointed. “Do I think this reunion makes sense? No. Do I care? F–k no. I got my Alex and Izzie endgame!” one fan tweeted at the time. Another wrote, “They killed all my other ships I will take this win idc idc idc Jo who? Alex and Izzie was my forever ship.”</p><p>As for potentially returning to Grey’s Anatomy herself, Heigl isn’t ready to write it off — however unlikely it may be. “I’m super focused on this show and my passion for it,” the Knocked Up star told ET. “I would <a href=#>never say never</a> but it’s not likely.”</p><p>Heigl left Grey’s Anatomy in 2010 during season 6 of the show — 10 seasons before Chambers surprised viewers by announcing <a href=#>his own exit</a>. The actress left the show on a contentious note, <a href=#>after a public falling out</a> with showrunner <a href=#><strong>Shonda Rhimes</strong></a>. After being nominated for a Primetime Emmy in 2007 for her performance on the show, Heigl withdrew her name.</p><p>She <a href=#>said</a> at the time, “I did not feel that I was given the material this season to <a href=#>warrant an Emmy nomination</a> and in an effort to maintain the integrity of the academy organization, I withdrew my name from contention.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Speaking with <a href=#><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a> after the fact in 2016, the Washington, D.C., native revealed that she later<a href=#> apologized to Rhimes</a>, 51, for her comments, noting that she “was really embarrassed.” The producer later named Heigl in a 2010 interview with <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> about difficult actors to work with on set.</p><p>“There are no Heigls in this situation,” she said at the time, adding that she adopted a “no a–holes policy” on set.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6rnamoeqK6wK2mprFdlrm2uYykmK2glae2r7GMoZyin5xiv6atwq2qZqyfYq6tsddmoLOymZp6s7HUp6Copl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-dusty-hill-4486647.html><span>←</span><span>ZZ Top Bassist &amp;amp; Rock &amp;amp; Roll Icon Dead At 72 Hollywood Life</span></a>
