MyFACTION will be similar to EA Sports’ Ultimate Team feature as well as other 2K Games’ MyTEAM modes.</p><p>From 2K Games:</p><p>With the launch of WWE® 2K22 just days away, 2K is sharing today a quick guide to the franchise-first MyFACTION mode.</p><p>MyFACTION is a new take on a classic team-building mode in which players collect, manage, and upgrade an array of WWE Superstars and Legends to create their ultimate four-person factions. Managers and Side Plates boost performance, while Logos, Wallpapers, and Nameplates allow for creative customization.</p><p>Building the perfect faction to rival legendary groups such as the nWo, D-Generation X, and Evolution is no small task. Some useful tips to remember:</p><ul><li>Players must make important choices when it comes to selecting the best Superstars for their factions and deploying the right boosts to take down the competition;</li><li>In need of some major muscle? Draft your favorite Powerhouse into action, like Big E or Rhea Ripley. If speed and devastating martial arts are in order, a Striker like Shinsuke Nakamura may be the way to go;</li><li>Between a roster packed with Superstars and Legends, and a wide range of specialized Side Plates, countless combinations are available, and experimentation is encouraged.</li></ul><p>Ready to hit the squared circle? MyFACTION players can pit their four-person factions against other fearsome foursomes in Faction Wars, test their mettle across various match types in Proving Grounds, topple a new Tower every week, or complete an assortment of daily challenges. There are three types of in-game currency available in MyFACTION:</p><ul><li>MyFACTION Points – which can be exchanged for card packs and contracts – are awarded for completing matches and challenges;</li><li>MyFACTION Tokens – which can be used in the Token Rewards market to unlock powerful WWE Superstar and Legend cards – are also awarded for completing matches and challenges; and</li><li>Virtual Currency – which is available for purchase and can be used exclusively in MyFACTION on card packs, boxes, and contracts.</li></ul><p>As an important reminder, anything that players can unlock with Virtual Currency can also be unlocked with MyFACTION Points. In addition, MyFACTION is an online single-player only experience, so players cannot gain a competitive advantage over other players by purchasing Virtual Currency.</p><p>Additional rewards can be earned in certain MyFACTION modes, including Weekly Towers and Faction Wars, where exciting, limited-time rewards refresh each month. New themed card packs will roll out frequently, offering players a legion of current Superstars and beloved Legends to add to their collections.</p><p>Players can begin building their dream factions when WWE 2K22 is available on March 11, 2022*. For more information on WWE 2K22, visit the game’s official website, become a fan on Facebook, follow the game on Twitter and Instagram using the hashtag #WWE2K22 or subscribe on YouTube.</p><p>WWE 2K22 is set to release on Friday, March 11 worldwide while users who purchase the deluxe and above editions can access the game on Tuesday, March 8.</p><p><a href=#>WWE 2K22 MyGM Mode Introduced In New Trailer</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFxamtxYWJ%2FrHnGmqSeq12ZsrWtyKWqZqaVrHquxcWamq2hn6N6rrvDnmShoZeduaqzx62qZq%2Bnmnpzt5Fr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-lovecraft-country-colorist-extra-from-hbo-horror-show-reveals-her-skin-was-darkened-on-tik-tok.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Kelli Amirah?
