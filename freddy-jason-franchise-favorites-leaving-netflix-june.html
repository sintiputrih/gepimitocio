Since then, we’ve received a couple&nbsp;Alien vs. Predator&nbsp;movies, the second of which performed so poorly that Fox split them back into their own separate entities, and to a much, much lesser extent,&nbsp;Lake Placid vs. Anaconda.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>If you missed the party back in 2003 though, then perhaps you’ve arrived later than expected thanks to Netflix. With so many different movies being at your disposal, I’d certainly hope that you’ve indulged in both A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th series, with their crossover serving as the cherry on top.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=755 data-injectable=true>Well, if you have yet to do so – or if you’d like one last chance to savor something featuring either Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees – then you’d better act fast because the streaming service will be pulling multiple pictures relevant to this discussion from its lineup as of June 1st. To be more specific, we’re talking about Jason X, Friday the 13th (2009) and Freddy vs. Jason itself.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/151819477383554199-23-670x353.jpg alt="Freddy vs. Jason" width=640 height=337 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>Believe it or not, the only movie representing either franchise as of June will be Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday. I don’t know about you, but that’s not exactly the prime example of the Friday the 13th series I’d want any entertainment enthusiast to start off with. In fact, that’s easily my least favorite entry.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=false>If you truly enjoy <strong>Freddy vs. Jason</strong>, then it’s highly recommended that you pick up a copy on either Blu-ray or DVD. Regardless, we’ll keep you posted if indeed it does return to Netflix before long. One would think October would be an opportune time for a comeback, but you can never be too sure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonaudlJnGbrbArKanZZanrq%2Bvx6KqnmWWlsOwvsitnKxlnJqut7XNoGSnnaSbuarEjKOsp51f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-parker-schnabel-gay-or-does-he-have-a-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Is Parker Schnabel Gay, Or Does He Have A Wife?
