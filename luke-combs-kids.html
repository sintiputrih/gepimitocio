Keep reading for details, including how it all links back to his new song "Take You With Me."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Luke Combs have kids? He already has one son, and just announced another!</h2><p>Back in 2020, Luke married his longtime girlfriend Nicole Hocking. The couple announced on Jan. 20, 2022, via Luke's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, that they were expecting their first child, a son, that coming summer. "Here we go y‚Äôall! Lil dude Combs is coming this spring! Couldn‚Äôt be more excited to start a family with this babe. It‚Äôs gonna be a hell of a ride," the star captioned his post.</p><p>Just as Luke said, their son Tex Lawrence was born in June 2022.

The song shifts perspectives from when Luke was young and looking up to his father to the present day when he now has a son of his own and is placed in his father's shoes.</p><p>The song's early moments are set in the past with Luke as a youngster. He sings, "Daddy, what's that mean, that little turtle and a rabbit? / He sat me in that seat, showed me the wheel and how to grab it / He said, 'I‚Äôll work the pedals if you climb up on my knee, I'll take you with me.'" Clearly, Luke reminisces fondly on his childhood days with his father.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>The country singer digs in deeper in the chorus where he says "If it was up to me, we'd do everything together / And when you're young like that, you think those days last forever / Didn't know back then how much those words would mean / 'I'll take you with m–µ.'"</p><p>Later on, Luke transitions to his current perspective now that he has a son of his own. He sings, "Got a youngin' of my own, he's too young to understand it / When he gets a little older, watchin' the stage where I'm standin' / He'll know it's about him when he hears me sing, 'I'll take you with me.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfocKssYycpqaao2K4qrDS</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./puerto-rico-investigating-jake-paul-after-viral-video-sparks-turtle-outrage.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Puerto Rico investigating Jake Paul after viral video sparks turtle outrage</span></a>
