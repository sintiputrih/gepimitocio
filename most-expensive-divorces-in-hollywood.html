Later, the couple adopted another son, David. The marriage didn't last, and they announced they were divorcing in October 2008.&nbsp;"It was unraveling throughout the last year," a source told <a href=#>People</a>&nbsp;at the time. "They were living separate lives and coming together every now and then for the cameras."</p><p>Just two months later, the divorce was finalized. Madonna's rep, Liz Rosenberg, told <a href=#>Reuters</a> that&nbsp;Madonna wound up paying Ritchie a sum between&nbsp;£50 million and&nbsp;£60 million ($76 million and $92 million in U.S. currency). According to Rosenberg, that also included their estate in the British countryside,&nbsp;Ashcombe, estimated to be worth approximately&nbsp;£20 million ($30 million). Their combined net worth was said to be $525 million, although most of those millions were Madonna's.&nbsp;</p><p>In a 2012 interview with <a href=#>Newsweek</a>, she made some rare comments about what had gone wrong. "Because when you start off, everything's great and lovely, and the person you've married is flawless, and you're flawless,"&nbsp;she said. "Then time goes by, and you share a life, you have children, and there are cracks in the veneer. It's not as romantic as it used to be. You think, 'This isn't what I thought it was going to be,' and 'How much am I willing to sacrifice?'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtnbYR1fo6mpqysXZrFsbHNrKCvnV2Ztre70ZycrGWZo3qpu8ulsLCnn5l8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./636270-polo-g-was-supposed-to-be-with-pop-smoke-the-day-he-died.html><span>←</span><span>Polo G Was Supposed To Be With Pop Smoke The Day He Died</span></a>
