As he continues to rebuild his momentum in the industry, the Atlanta rapper has spoken out about some of the mischievous experiences he encountered in the business. During a recent sit down with DJ Akademics on his Off The Record podcast, Quan revealed that <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Travis Scott</a>'s 2014 hit "Mamacita" featuring himself and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Thug</a> was&nbsp;originally his song before it went to Scott.</p><p>Rich Homie Quan performing in 2017- Rick Diamond/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In a snippet of the interview, the "Type of Way" rapper claims that <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Metro Boomin</a> had the beat ready for him but had let Travis get a preview of it. “After we did ‘Mamacita,’ ‘Mamacita’ was my song,” Rich Homie Quan shared. "Bro you gon fact check. I’m dropping you gems. ‘Mamacita’ was my song. Travis Scott, he know it, he’ll keep it real with you. Thug will tell you that. You know Thug can’t talk right now, free my boy, but Travis Scott will tell you that was my song."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Quan didn't stop there.

"Hardest n-gga outside of Atlanta, the most talented of this younger generation: Kodak Black.&nbsp;This n-gga so dope man. He probably don’t even f**k with me man. Cause we be DMing and stuff, but I ain’t gonna lie as far as like different flows, versatility, that n-gga hard, boy. Listen when I’m telling you, like, me and Yak get in there.
