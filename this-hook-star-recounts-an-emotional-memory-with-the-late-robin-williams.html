He said while off set, the pair connected over his Filipino nationality:</p><p>“One day, Robin pulled me aside, and he was like, ‘Dante, where are you from?’ I was explaining to him, ‘I’m from the Bay Area,’ and he goes like, ‘Oh, yeah, me too.’ I was like, ‘Oh, yeah, of course. Robin, everyone knows you’re from San Francisco. You’re a legendary San Francisco cat.’ And he goes, ‘No, but where’s your family from originally?” I’m like, ‘Oh, I’m Filipino.’ And he goes, ‘Oh, I thought so.’ His wife at the time, Marsha, ‘My wife’s half Filipino, and you totally remind me of my father-in-law.’”</p><p data-characters=86 data-current-count=86 data-injectable=false>The actor wrapped up his statement by explaining how welcomed Williams made him feel.</p><p>“He starts talking about that and the culture and the family. You feel like you’re an outsider looking in a lot when you’re in Hollywood. It’s all these big movie stars at the big party. And even being on the set in the movie with them, you still feel like they’re in their own little world. He had a way of putting his arm around me and going like, “No, man. You’re welcome. This is for you.” I’ll never forget him for that.”</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=163 data-injectable=false><strong>Robin Williams</strong> tragically passed away at age 63 on August 11th, 2014.
