On July 11, 2022, she attained a career-high rating of world No. 11 in singles, and on August 15, 2022, she attained a career-high position of world No. 1 in doubles. Gauff, who is 15 years old, became the youngest singles title winner on the WTA Tour since 2004 when she won the 2019 Linz Open. She has won five doubles titles on the WTA Tour, including three with Caty McNally and two with Jessica Pegula. She has also won two WTA Tour singles titles. Gauff became well-known after defeating Venus Williams in the first round of Wimbledon in 2019.</p><p>Gauff played a variety of sports as a kid. His parents were NCAA Division I university athletes in basketball and track & field. Inspired by the Williams sisters and favoring an individual sport, she decided to play tennis.</p><p>Gauff achieved success as a junior and received funding to attend the French academy of Patrick Mouratoglou. She started competing on the ITF Junior Circuit at the age of 13, and in just her fourth ITF competition, she placed second at the junior US Open in 2017, making her the youngest finalist in the tournament’s history. After defeating McNally to win the junior French Open singles championship, she rose to the top of the junior rankings. Additionally, she and McNally won a junior Grand Slam doubles title at the 2018 US Open.</p><p>Gauff won her opening match when she joined the WTA Tour in March 2019 at the Miami Open. She was given a wildcard for the Wimbledon Championships qualifying round in 2019, where she advanced to the main draw at the tournament’s youngest-ever age. Through the first week of television coverage in the United States, each of her matches there until the fourth round were the most watched of the day. She entered the third round of the US Open later that summer while still only 15 years old. She competed in women’s doubles at the US Open in 2021 and made it to her first major singles final at the 2022 French Open.</p><table class="infobox vcard"><tbody readability=4.5><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row>Country&nbsp;(sports)</th><td class=infobox-data>United States</td></tr><tr readability=4><th class=infobox-label scope=row>Born</th><td class=infobox-data>March 13, 2004<span class="noprint ForceAgeToShow">&nbsp;(age&nbsp;18)</span><br>Atlanta, Georgia</td></tr><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row>Height</th><td class=infobox-data>1.75&nbsp;m (5&nbsp;ft 9&nbsp;in)</td></tr><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row>Turned&nbsp;pro</th><td class=infobox-data>2018</td></tr><tr readability=2><th class=infobox-label scope=row>Plays</th><td class=infobox-data>Right-handed (double-handed backhand)</td></tr><tr readability=3><th class=infobox-label scope=row>Coach</th><td class=infobox-data>Corey Gauff<br>Jean-Christophe Faurel, Diego Moyano</td></tr><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row>Prize money</th><td class=infobox-data>US$ 4,840,896&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Early_life><span id=Early_life class=mw-headline>Early life</span></span></h2><p>Gauff was born on March 13, 2004, to Delray Beach, Florida natives Candi and Corey Gauff. Codey, who is four years younger than her, and Cameron, who is nine years younger, are her two younger brothers. Her mother was a track and field athlete at Florida State University and a teacher, while her father was a college basketball player at Georgia State University who subsequently worked as a health care executive. Gauff was raised in Atlanta, and at the age of four, after watching Serena Williams win the 2009 Australian Open on television, she developed an interest in tennis. Her parents pushed her to participate in a variety of activities, including track and basketball. She started playing tennis when she was six years old, and after winning the “Little Mo” eight-and-under national championship at the age of eight, she made the decision to make tennis her career because it was an individual sport. I wasn’t much of a team person, Gauff recalled. I cherished tennis. Since I didn’t want to practice at all when I was younger, I was initially ambivalent about it. All I wanted was to have fun with my buddies. I started playing “Little Mo” when I was eight years old, and I made the decision to continue doing it for the rest of my life.</p><p>Gauff’s family returned to Delray Beach when she was seven years old so that she might receive better instruction. Prior to purchasing their own home, they initially resided with the parents of her mother. She began working with Gerard Loglo at the New Generation Tennis Academy when she was eight years old while living in Florida. Gauff’s parents left their jobs to devote their time to raising their daughter. Later, her mother managed her homeschooling while her father served as her primary coach. Her father had little prior tennis playing experience. Patrick Mouratoglou, Serena Williams’ longtime coach, opened the Mouratoglou Academy in France when Gauff was 10 years old. I’ll always remember the first time I saw Coco, Mouratoglou said. She visited the Mouratoglou Academy in 2014 to give it a shot, and I was very struck by her tenacity, athleticism, and battling spirit. You can only believe it when she tells you she will be number one while looking at you. Through the Champ’Seed foundation, which he established to support gifted youngsters without the money to pay for expensive training, he helped finance Gauff.</p><p>Gauff continued to excel, becoming the youngest champion in the history of the USTA Clay Court National 12-and-under at the age of 10 years and 3 months.</p><h2><span id=Junior_career><span id=Junior_career class=mw-headline>Junior career</span></span></h2><p>Gauff was a former junior world number one. At age 12, she competed in the prestigious Les Petits As 14-and-under tournament and advanced to the semifinals. At the age of 13, Gauff started competing on the ITF Junior Circuit, skipping right up to the Grade A and Grade 1 competitions. In her third competition, the Grade 1 Prince George’s County Junior Tennis Championships in Maryland, she came in second place to Jaimee Fourlis. Gauff lost to Amanda Anisimova in her subsequent match at the 2017 US Open, when she made her junior Grand Slam debut. Before either tournament’s final, she didn’t lose a set. Gauff finished as the US Open’s youngest-ever girls’ singles finalist.</p><p>Gauff lost her opening round match at the Australian Open after beginning 2018 with a semifinal finish at the Grade 1 Traralgon Junior International in Australia. She didn’t compete in another singles match until the French Open, where she claimed her first junior Grand Slam victory. She didn’t lose a set until the championship match, when she overcame a deficit to beat McNally in three sets. Gauff achieved the fifth-youngest girls’ singles champion record at the French Open with the victory. She rose to the top of the junior rankings a month later after winning another final match against McNally at the Grade 1 Junior International Roehampton.</p><p>During the year’s final two Grand Slam competitions, Gauff advanced to the singles quarterfinals. She performed better in doubles at both competitions, advancing to the semifinals with partner Mara Lourdes Carlé at Wimbledon and taking home her maiden junior Grand Slam doubles trophy with McNally at the US Open. Gauff and McNally won the championship match in straight sets over fellow countrymen Hailey Baptiste and Dalayna Hewitt. Gauff, together with Alexa Noel and Connie Ma, represented the United States at the Junior Fed Cup in September. The team faced Ukraine in the championship game. Gauff and Noel won the Junior Fed Cup by defeating Lyubov Kostenko and Dasha Lopatetskaya 11-9 in the match tiebreak after Gauff won her singles rubber and Noel lost hers. Gauff ended the year in the Orange Bowl with another Grade A singles victory. In second place to Clara Burel at the end of the season, she was rated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tor5ikeqK%2BxGaaqJufYrSiwcWfqmarmZe5qrrGrGSlnZGnu26twaisrWWTlrqmvs6nZKCZpZuzbq3NnWScp5Saxm6zwK6dn2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shirtless-rocco-ritchie-packs-on-the-pda-with-mystery-brunette-during-beach-day-in-sardinia.html><span>←</span><span>Shirtless Rocco Ritchie packs on the PDA with mystery brunette during beach day in Sardinia</span></a>
