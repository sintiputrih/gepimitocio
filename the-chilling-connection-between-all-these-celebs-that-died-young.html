She immediately jumped to fame by starring in over 72 commercials before making the successful transition to film. The <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a> estimated that the young star was making $100,000 a year. As she began a dream career in Hollywood, her life behind the scenes became a nightmare. Hidden to many, Barsi lived a terrifying life at home due to an abusive and alcoholic father. He not only threatened Barsi's life but repeatedly was violent toward her mother, leading her to call the authorities on one occasion. Any time she was away from home, the young girl complained about returning to her home environment, telling friends, "I'm afraid to go home. My daddy is miserable. My daddy is drunk every day, and I know he wants to kill my mother."</p><p dir=ltr>Sadly, her fears came true. When she was 10, Barsi's father <a href=#>brutally murdered</a> her and her mother before turning the gun on himself. In a heartbreaking twist, her final role before her death was in the animated movie "<a href=#>All Dogs Go To Heaven</a>,"&nbsp;in which she voiced the character Anne-Marie — a child who lost both her parents. This film, in which she plays an orphan, was released a year and a half after her death.</p><p>If you or anyone you know is struggling with addiction issues, help is available.
