A source had told <a href=#>TMZ</a> that the "Redneck Woman" singer had gotten into a fight with another passenger aboard an American Airlines flight from Washington D.C. According to <a href=#>CNN</a>, after landing, the star was&nbsp;arrested and then charged by state police after acting belligerently toward them.</p><p paraid=144608544 paraeid={46a1bd01-d825-45eb-8dab-e83fb8639ce3}{95} lang=en-us>Wilson addressed the alleged incident a week later, informing&nbsp;her <a href=#>Facebook</a> followers that she couldn't go into details due to legal reasons. However, just a few days later, she did claim to&nbsp;<a href=#>Taste of Country</a>&nbsp;that the tabloid version of her troubles was far from the truth.&nbsp;"People who know me know that I just wanna get it straight," she said. "I'm reading all of these headlines ... like, 'Oh gosh, it's so wrong, it's all so wrong!'"&nbsp;</p><p paraid=144608544 paraeid={46a1bd01-d825-45eb-8dab-e83fb8639ce3}{95} lang=en-us>In September 2018, the charges against Wilson were eventually dropped,&nbsp;per <a href=#>People</a>. In order to settle the charge, Wilson agreed to donate $500 to a charity. Two months later, in another interview with Taste of Country,&nbsp;she <a href=#>further insisted</a>&nbsp;that the drama had been a misunderstanding and she wasn't involved in any altercation on an airplane. Per&nbsp;<a href=#>AP</a>, Wilson griped to the press that celebrities simply weren't allowed to have off days like ordinary people.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtiZoJzgo6wn5qslauys3nHmqepnZ6asW6z0Z6rnKCVo3q4tcuspqdn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./two-days-to-piece-together-tiahleigh-palmers-final-two-hours.html><span>←</span><span>Two days to piece together Tiahleigh Palmers final two hours</span></a>
