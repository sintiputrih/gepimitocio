Chris Higbee (fiddle), Abby (lead vocals), Dave Cramer (keyboards, vocals), Ryan Lucotch (drums), Jeff Volek (bass), and Junior (electric guitar) are the magic six from the outskirts of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that make this group unlike any other country act that is out there.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Most Unusual Religious Rituals And Beliefs In The World</h2><time>Jul 3, 2024</time>
