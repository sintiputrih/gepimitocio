And no. He is not likely to quit anytime soon.</p><p>In all those years, the world has seen Kris being pretty great as a miner, despite him being constantly thwarted by his own family.</p><p>Yet, over the years viewers have also witnessed Kelly’s different schemes tumbling to varying degrees. And at these times, the camera has candidly caught him unable to hide his emotions. He has often been seen amid his meltdowns.</p><p>Be that as it may, these losses have not stopped him from longing to prove his legitimacy as a miner. Despite being knocked back again and again, it’s his eternal optimism and big dreams that have actually kept the family moving forward as miners.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Kris Kelly’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Kris Kelly, as the captain and co-owner of The Reaper, reportedly had a net worth valued at $200,000 as of early 2023.</p><p>In addition to his yields from ice mining,&nbsp;Kris also gets paid by Discovery for his participation in&nbsp;Bering Sea Gold.

Despite his family’s drama unfolding on the show, this one aspect of his life has remained an exception.</p><p>He seems to have put much effort to ensure that his life with his partner precisely stays undocumented. Also, it does not help that he is not putting anything of this sort on social media.</p><p>However, despite all his attempts at privacy, we have come to know that he most likely has a baby also named Kris. It’s a daughter and she turned one before April 2022. “One last break before ice mining”, Kris himself was seen spending some time with the adorable young one back in January 2022.</p><p>And now that there is a baby, there is also a baby mama.

It was he who brought his sons to Nome years ago to follow his dreams of getting rich quickly.</p><p>The world was first introduced to the Kellys when the patriarch of the clan made his way onto the show during season 2, in 2012. Then, they got to know his two sons, Andrew, aka Andy, and Kris, and their mom (Brad’s wife) Wendy.</p><p>Fans also witnessed Wendy and Brad’s feud which is believed to have lasted well over 30 years. Then, there entered the baby mama, Courtney. It was to help her and their newly born that Brad had stolen money from his own sons souring their relationship.</p><p>Besides his dad, Kris also has regularly butted heads with his brother. The latter two have not appeared as ambitious as Kris to the audience.</p><p>About Kris’s mother Wendy Sue Kelly: she turned 61 years old in April 2022 and had been residing in Keaau, Hawaii following her split with Brad.</p><p>You should also know that back in 2021, there were rumors about a death in the Kelly family.
