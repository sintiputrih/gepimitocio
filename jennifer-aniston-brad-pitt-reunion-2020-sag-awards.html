He mentioned that his character in Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood was a regular guy who just "doesn't get on with his wife." The camera then moved over to Aniston in the crowd, who grinned and clapped at the reference.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Let’s be honest, it was a difficult part," Pitt joked. "The guy who gets high, takes his shirt off, and doesn’t get on with his wife. It’s a big stretch. Big."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though their reunion was brief, it was obvious from their body language that the pair weren't keen on parting after crossing paths. Brad even reached for Jen as she turned to leave after they exchanged a few words.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emma McIntyre/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair also attended the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Golden Globe awards</a> earlier this month, though they apparently didn't make their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>long-awaited reconnection</a> there – as far as the public could see, anyway. Pitt told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Entertainment Tonight</a> at the time that he'd "run into" her, calling her his "good friend."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aniston and Pitt initially split in 2005 after five years of marriage. While Pitt went on to marry <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Angelina Jolie</a>, from who he's now divorced, Aniston wed Justin Theroux in 2015. They've also split up since then. Despite dissolving their marriage in 2005, Jen and Brad have maintained a friendly relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now that we've had another taste of Jen and Brad together, though, we just can't help but crave more of the pair already.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeamruvtcWeqWaZnp7AtbvNZpmrmZRivarA02apnq2enryveZFpaWllo5a0bq3Wmqmdqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./henny-backus.html><span>←</span><span>Henny Backus Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
