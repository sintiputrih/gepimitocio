It wasn't until weeks later when the last bandage was finally removed that he realized <a href=#>he'd lost his finger</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>He said, "And I remember it didn't hurt or anything. It was just a sort of buzzing sensation. I don't associate any pain with it. For me, the traumatic part of it was after the doctor amputated it, I had this big cast and bandages on it. And they gradually got smaller and smaller, until I was down to like one little bandage. And I thought for sure my finger was under there. I just knew it was. And that was the worst part, when the bandage came off. 'Oh, my God, my finger's gone.' But after that, it was okay, because as a kid, if you have a few little things that make you different, it's a good score. So I got a lot of mileage out of having a missing finger when I was a kid."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAj29ub3BfrLWiwIyypq5llJ6xr8CMpKWor12Wr7DB02ahnqqirnqordGcoJqrXaK2tL%2FIp55mmaClsq%2BwwKCcaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-albert-on-little-house-on-the-prairie.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Albert On Little House On The Prairie?</span></a>
