Modern Warfare 3 Season 1 is now finally here, and players can’t wait to start grinding for their fancy camos and skins. In the previous Call of Duty games, some of the most prestigious camos were Gold Camos, which players can unlock by completing a set of challenges. However, it seems that Gold Camo’s challenges are currently bugged. For some, MW3 Gold Camo Challenges don’t show up. For others, challenges are not tracking and progressing. Finally, some players are unable to equip MW3 gold camos. In our guide, we explain <strong>how to equip Gold Camo in Modern Warfare 3 and how to unlock them.</strong></p><a href=# rel=attachment><img fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.gosu-noob.com/static/img/1/2022/10/MW2-Gold-Camo-Challenges-Not-Showing-Cant-Unlock-Gold-Skin-640x360.webp data-no-lazy=1 alt="MW3 Gold Camo Challenges Not Showing, Can't Unlock Gold Skin" width=640 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>Image Credit: u/hellarios852 via Reddit<h2>MW3 Gold Camo Challenges not Registering, Can’t Unlock Gold Skins</h2><p><strong>UPDATE on December 6th, 2023: With the release of the Season 1 update in Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone 2, players have again lost their Gold camo progress. Players report across Reddit and forums that their “gold progress has been reset with the newest update”. We will update the article once we have more information. Activision and Sledgehammer are yet to acknowledge these issues.</strong></p>';document.getElementById("serge_5f895c6208f81a315320ec57").style.display = "block"; }<p>When first revealed, many players were happy to see that this time around, Gold Camos will be unlockable relatively fast. First reports indicated that players should expect to spend around four hours per Gold Camo to unlock it, which is much less time than in previous COD games. True, some didn’t like this, as they thought this chips off the prestige quality of these skins. However, there’s currently an annoying bug related to Gold Camos in MW3. Namely, it seems that players are unable to unlock them. Or, to be more precise, MW3 Gold Camo Challenges are <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">not showing</a> for some players.</p><p>Why is this happening? Well, the challenges are still there; it’s just that they do not appear for some reason. For example, to unlock the M4 gold camo, you’ll need to complete the “<strong>Get 3 kills without dying 10 times</strong>” challenge. It doesn’t show up, but you can still complete it, and you’ll unlock the M4 gold camo. Now, there’s another problem here. Many players can’t select and equip their Gold Camo in MW3. This is because there is a mouse bug currently. Hovering with the mouse over Camos or challenges will not work. Rather, <strong>you will have to use a controller or your keyboard to select the camo</strong> manually. With that said, that’s all you need to know about the “MW3 Gold Camo Challenges Not Showing” bug.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvSrqWop5JjsLC5jpymnWWdpLGmvs1mrpqqlpa%2FpnmRaKSwal2cvK2wjJyYpqddmLWiuMuepaCdo2K7sMCMrJ%2Bor5mjtG6vwKerZq2eobykt4ygpqWcXai4qrqO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./martin-kabrhel-allegations-and-controversy-what-did-he-do-scandal-details.html><span>←</span><span>Martin Kabrhel Allegations And Controversy: What Did He Do?
