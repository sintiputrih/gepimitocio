This post also revealed her new hairstyle.</p><p>However, her new hairstyle is not the only striking difference that has caught the attention of her fans. The 77-year-old singer's admirers often gaze upon her tiny waist, which makes them wonder how she stays in shape at this stage of her life. The star, however, had once spilled the beans behind how she kept her waist thin.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>How does Parton get such a tiny waist?</h2><p>The singer told that she consumes a low-carb diet during the week. Parton allows herself to eat whatever she desires only during the weekend. “I do have to watch it because I’m only about 5 feet, and you can’t hold on to too much weight when you’re so short,” she said in the interview with the outlet. “So, I stay on a low-carb diet pretty much through the week and eat what I want on weekends. And of course, nothing matters on Thanksgiving and Christmas!”'</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/968c3e57-0de7-4d9f-87a2-3800172c017e.1439402870><h2 class=split>Parton's husband likes her appearance</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>Parton's husband, Carl Dean, apparently finds her physique quite alluring. The singer opened up on her relationship with her husband during a 1981 interview with Ladies’ Home Journal. She disclosed that Dean likes to buy her “sexy underwear” and also added that he likes the most when she puts on hot pants. “Carl also buys me sexy underwear, and for some reason, he loves me in hot pants, especially when I lose weight,” she said. &nbsp;“He’ll say, now go put on them hot pants.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/d8754a6a-7eef-4fae-a179-5986ddf9fbbd.1382653936> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/707b4acc-ed42-4c99-86ae-24dcd67a60d8.1382701241><h2 class=split>Parton tries to look good for her husband even when she is at home</h2><p>Dolly Parton also detailed her life and music during the interview. When asked if she likes to dress properly even when she’s at home with her husband, the singer replied that she does pay heed to her looks even if it is just the two of them. “I don’t want to look good for everyone else and like a slouch for him!” declared Parton. “So even if we’re just driving around in our RV camper and hitting all the local fast-food joints, I’ll tease my hair and put it up in a little scrunchie.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/b36b9461-0bcc-40db-a34a-92e0ff21bafe.1382617010><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRonJ%2Bhubp5z5qpraeeYryxsc2em2atoGKuo7vUrWSsnZOnsrV5w6KcrWWkp7akt4ysn55lpaiytHnTqGSmmZmjwaK1zWafnqpdqbavxYywmKKrpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./430548-serena-williams-x-nike-air-force-1-low-lapis-release-date-revealed-news.html><span>←</span><span>Serena Williams x Nike Air Force 1 Low &amp;quot;Lapis&amp;quot; Release Date Revealed</span></a>
