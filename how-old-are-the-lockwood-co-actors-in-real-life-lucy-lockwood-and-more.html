Since launching in 2014, the series has grown to span six critically-acclaimed books. The Netflix version of&nbsp;Lockwood & Co.&nbsp;adapts the first two of these books,&nbsp;The Screaming Staircase, and&nbsp;The Whispering Skull.</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=760 data-injectable=true>The series is set in an alternate version of London, where spirits and other supernatural entities run rampant, harming the populace if not tightly controlled. This has led to society getting stuck in the early-1980s, meaning this version of London lacks most of the digital conveniences we take for granted. To counter the spirits, teams of teenage ghost hunters roam the night, doing their best to handle any hauntings they come across.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>The story follows&nbsp;Lockwood & Co.,&nbsp;a ghost-hunting group. This group consists of three young people, the psychic Lucy Carlyle, teen entrepreneur Anthony Lockwood, and the eccentric George Karim. However, unlike many other ghost-hunting firms,&nbsp;Lockwood & Co.&nbsp;isn’t corporate, meaning they don’t work to generate profit. Plus,&nbsp;Lockwood & Co.&nbsp;has no adult supervisors, and its three teen teammates investigate things others would prefer they didn’t.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How old is the actor playing Lucy Carlyle?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>Ruby Stokes is 22 years old and was born on Sept. 4th, 2000.
