Making the Cut Season 3 will be available on Amazon on August 19 at 12 a.m. GMT.&nbsp;Furthermore, on July 28, the program unveiled the official trailer, which included some high fashion ensembles designed by fashion entrepreneurs as well as some fascinating drama among the judges.</p><p>Making the Cut Season 3 will have entrepreneurs brainstorming each week to produce amazing runway outfits for the judges to assess. The most interesting feature of the event is that the winning outfits will be available for purchase on Amazon in limited editions right away, and viewers will be able to shop for them if they like them.</p><p>According to the show’s official synopsis:</p><p>“Season Three will showcase a new group of ten entrepreneurs and designers from across the globe who are eager to take their budding companies to the next level and become the newest worldwide sensation,” says the show’s website.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Making-The-Cut-3.jpg alt="Making The Cut" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It continues:</p><p>“The series winner will get $1 million to invest in their company as well as coaching from Amazon Fashion. The winner will also be able to develop an exclusive co-brand with Amazon Fashion and launch their current brands on the Amazon Fashion shop.”</p><h2>What is the Making the Cut format?</h2><p>Making the Cut, unlike previous catwalk exhibitions, focuses on the ‘look-creating’ process of aspiring designers. Furthermore, they will be required to produce two looks: an ‘accessible look’ and a ‘runway look.’ Every week, they must display their outfits on the fashion catwalk, which will be set against stunning scenery in Los Angeles.&nbsp;The judges will choose the eventual winner, who will get $1 million and further possibilities to promote their brand in the fashion industry, based on their work.</p><p>The show will also feature “new brand collaborations, including an activewear challenge with iconic brand Champion, and expanded collections from each week’s winning designers, giving fans and customers even more opportunities to shop in Amazon Fashion’s Making the Cut store,” according to the show’s description.&nbsp;In addition, the new season will include some classic Los Angeles settings such as Beverly Hills’ Rodeo Drive, the unusual desert scenery of Vasquez Rocks, and a rooftop of one of Downtown LA’s numerous skyscrapers with panoramic views of the city skyline.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Making-The-Cut-2-1.jpg alt="Making The Cut" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Furthermore, the event will be judged by Nicole Richie, creative director of House of Harlow 1960, and Jeremy Scott, fashion pop phenomenon and creative director of Moschino.&nbsp;Pop singers Chloe x Halle, A-List stylist Jason Bolden, designer TikToker, and model Wisdom Kaye will all make cameos in the evening.
