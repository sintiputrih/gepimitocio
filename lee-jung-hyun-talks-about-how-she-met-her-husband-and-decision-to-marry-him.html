I was of the mindset that I should just work hard on my career.”</p><p>She continued, “While working in this field, there aren’t many opportunities to date. I was also cautious about dating another celebrity. I went into filming for ‘Love, Again, 2018,’ and after meeting <a href=# onclick='_gaq.push(["_trackEvent","outbound-article","http://www.viki.com"])'>Kwon Sang Woo</a> and <a href=# onclick='_gaq.push(["_trackEvent","outbound-article","http://www.viki.com"])'>Lee Jong Hyuk</a> who are crazy about&nbsp;their kids, I got the feeling that I wanted to get married again.”</p><p>Lee Jung Hyun explained, “Kwon Sang Woo and Lee Jong Hyuk are very family-oriented. They can’t do anything against their wives, and they always send pictures of the park or place they visited with their family to the group chat. I was very jealous after seeing [the pictures]. I wished I had a family like that as well.”</p><p>On her marriage, Lee Jung Hyun said, “[We] developed romantic feelings while I was filming ‘Love, Again, 2018,’ and we held our wedding near the end of filming.”</p><p>The actress said, “I met my husband through a blind date. He’s such a nice and sincere person, I thought, ‘Ah, it would be nice to get married to this person.’ My husband was originally a big fan of me. He has all my albums from my first album.”</p><p>Finally, Lee Jung Hyun said, “I think it’s a fortune that I met my husband. I was thankful. It’s to the point where I wondered if there’s someone out there who likes me this much. I’m very thankful.” She added, “I really want children. We’re planning [to have children].”</p><p>Watch a teaser for Lee Jung Hyun’s upcoming film <a href=#>here</a>!</p><p>Source (<a href=#>1</a>)</p><p>How does this article make you feel?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvOpqeiZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVZH50gZdqb3CvoKV8rbHEZqGuppditbrBzWarmqSbqHqirs6uq2agn6x6tLTEZqSerF2dsrN5x66qm5memXqiusNmm56bmai2sLqMraZmpZGnv7p5x6Kk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./teagan-croft-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth-html.html><span>←</span><span>Teagan Croft Height, Age, Boyfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</span></a>
