<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Christopher Schurr A Cop Is Charged With A Second Degree Murder Charge For Killing Patrick Lyoya</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The officer who shot Patrick Lyoya in Michigan will face second-degree murder charges, according to Kent County prosecutor Chris Becker, who spoke during a news conference on Thursday. Following a lengthy battle, the accused police officer, Christopher Schurr, shot Lyoya in the back of the head, as seen by an eyewitness.&nbsp;The prosecution said the following regarding the ingredients of second-degree murder:</p><p>“The death was neither justified nor excused by self-defense, for example.”</p><p>According to Becker, if convicted of second-degree murder, the accused will be sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of release. Meanwhile, defense attorneys have described the shooting as “a regrettable event” rather than a murder.&nbsp;People were outraged when a white officer killed a black guy, with many marching to the streets demanding justice for Lyoya and heavy punishment for Schurr.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>BREAKING: The officer who shot Patrick Lyoya, a 26-year-old Black man, in the back of the head, will be CHARGED with second-degree murder.</p><p>Who’s glad the officer will be held accountable? ✋</p><p>— CALL TO ACTIVISM (@CalltoActivism) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">June 9, 2022</a></p><h2>Patrick Lyoya’s father is seeking justice for his son’s killing.</h2><p>Patrick Lyoya, a Congolese black guy, was requested to pull over on April 4 because his license plate didn’t match the automobile. A violent confrontation followed between Lyoya and Schurr moments later. Schurr fatally shot and murdered Lyoya after they struggled on the ground in the rain for some time. Following the incident, Schurr was placed on administrative leave. Meanwhile, Grand Rapids Police Chief Eric Winstrom has suggested that Schurr be dismissed. However, the officer is entitled to a hearing, and the decision will be made by the city manager.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Christopher-Schurr-2.jpg alt="Christopher Schurr" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Meanwhile, Becker’s revelation of the second-degree accusation drew a huge reaction. Ben Crump, Lyoya’s family lawyer, argued that the murder charge was the correct decision and that Schurr must be held responsible.&nbsp;Becker also notified Patrick Lyoya’s parents of the allegations and sent a letter in Swahili, their native language, to them. Patrick Lyoya’s father, Peter Lyoya, expressed satisfaction with the decision, saying:</p><p>“We were certain that there was no justice in America until today. What I want is complete justice for my kid.”</p><p>Schurr reportedly handed himself in on Thursday and was scheduled to appear in court on Friday. His personnel file is rather simple, with no accusations of excessive force. He has, however, been praised for busting and arresting people in incidents involving the recovery of firearms and narcotics.</p><p>Winstrom commented on what the murder charge implies for the department, saying:</p><p>“The police department is going to have a terrible time. We’ll make it through.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/patrick-lyoya-1.jpg alt="patrick lyoya" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Robert Womack, a black Kent County commissioner, has argued that the witness’s video evidence was crucial in charging Schurr with murder. Despite the officer wearing a body camera, the killing was not recorded because it was likely removed as the duo fell to the ground.</p><p>Separately, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel addressed the matter.</p><p>“At the Attorney General’s Office, we recognize the extraordinary resources required to investigate police-involved shooting fatalities, and I thank Prosecutor Becker, his staff, and the Michigan State Police for their thorough investigation over the previous two months.”</p><p>She continued, saying:</p><p>“We must now follow the legal process and enable the facts of the case to be exposed in court.”</p><p>Patrick Lyoya was killed by an officer against the background of the George Floyd case, which sparked national outrage.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaoaqZqMGwvMeeqWark53Cs76MmmScp6BitrR5wqGYq5%2BVmXq4tdOhZJplo5qwsLrDZpuen6Kasm651KubnqpdmLWivsaeZJ%2BnomK4qrjLoqWgZaCWwbO1wqRkpbGfrq5w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aristotle-onassis-net-worth-128193.html><span>←</span><span>Aristotle Onassis Net Worth</span></a>
