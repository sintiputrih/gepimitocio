<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>A Blessing in Disguise Kurt Angle Finally Breaks Silence on His WWE Release</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>WWE Hall of Famer Kurt Angle recently spoke about his <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>career</a>, leaving the WWE, and his future prospects and businesses. Angle sat down with Justin Barasso of Sports Illustrated in an interview and gave fans a glimpse of his life in and around the ring. Angle went on to manage several successful businesses after his time in the WWE. He also commented on his business ventures, and how his release from the WWE benefitted him after all. “It was almost a blessing in disguise that WWE released me, The business started picking up orders, and we’re at a point where I really need to be here.”</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><span>Kurt Angle refused a job from WWE</span></h2><p><span>Angle revealed that he was initially going to be hired as Matt Riddle’s manager on Friday Night Smackdown. He passed on the job however and states that it was a blessing in disguise.</span></p><p><span>“</span><span>WWE offered me a job to manage Matt Riddle. Unfortunately, I turned it down. I just have so much going with my business, Physically Fit Nutrition, and I need to make sure it succeeds before I do anything else</span><span>”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Corbin-Kurt-Angle.jpg><p><span>Kurt was also asked about his potential return to the world of pro-wrestling. His last appearance in the ring was against Baron Corbin at Wrestlemania 35. Since then, Angle has been holding back from performing in the ring and focusing more on making his body better, after years and years of physical punishment. “</span><span>Right now, I can’t. Could my mind be changed? Yes, for two reasons. I’m working on my business, and I’ve been doing a lot of rehab on my body. Trying to get myself back to where I’m able to live a healthy lifestyle. I’d been so banged up—my neck, my back, and my neck—but I’m making improvements.</span><span>”</span></p><p><span>Besides his pro-wrestling career, and his time in the WWE, Angle also opened up about his <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>future</a>, with his businesses. “</span><span>We have chicken snacks called Chxn Snx, and they will be a number one seller. This will not only be available on Amazon, but also in convenience stores, health food stores, groceries, and bulk stores like Costco and Sam’s Club</span><span>”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9awnGamlazAbq2Mm6Oeq6Oeu6h5yKdknaGjnMKqv8Rmoq6qpGKur7PLnmSfoZ6Wua3FjJupnpmbqHq0tcuepZydXaS7brTIrGSwr5Viv6a4xJqqnmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kourtney-kardashian-boohoo-nyfw-show.html><span>←</span><span>Kourtney Kardashian stages Boohoo NYFW show amid sustainability backlash</span></a>
