The Second City Savior was backstage for a little while, but then Vince McMahon remotely made the call that he needed to go.</p><p><a href=#>Click here for our complete coverage of WWE RAW this week</a></p><p><a href=#>As we previously reported,</a> CM Punk was asked to leave WWE RAW this week, but he was backstage for a while. Punk reportedly got to see several members of the roster and also talk to Triple H.</p><p>It was also reported <a href=#>exactly who asked CM Punk to leave.</a> Some WWE Superstars believed that <a href=#>CM Punk only showed up to hype his AEW return.</a> CM Punk and <a href=#>The Miz were also able to bury the hatchet.</a></p><p><a href=#>Ringside News</a> reached out to see how people in the company really felt about CM Punk showing up backstage at WWE RAW. We were told by a tenured member of the creative team that, “No one cared about Punk being there.”</p><p>It was explained to us that WWE had a sold out in advance crowd in Chicago, creative changes, a pay-per-view in 12 days, and sold out live events, all at the same time. “To WWE stars, who is CM Punk?” it was said to us.</p><p><a href=#>It was reported that CM Punk </a>received a warm reception from who he spoke to backstage, but that doesn’t mean his presence really made an impact. After all, this was a very busy night for him to pop in on an unannounced visit.</p><p>CM Punk could very well show up on AEW television again very soon. With the company’s Saturday show starting up in a matter of weeks, the general thought is that CM Punk will be a big name on that program. Only time will tell what CM Punk does next, but he probably won’t try another stunt like this again for a very long time.</p><p>What’s your take on CM Punk showing up before WWE RAW in Chicago?
