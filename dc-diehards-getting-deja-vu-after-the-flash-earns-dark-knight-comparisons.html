That’s their job after after all. It’s also an even better opportunity for those of us inclined to write articles on the topic to compare said film to all those that came before it — and again, why wouldn’t we? It’s our job.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>That’s why The Dark Knight is so hard to beat. It’s not just a great superhero film, it’s a great film in general. The jury is out, the results are in, Christopher Nolan’s 2008 film is piece of perfection. Period. That’s why whenever DC rolls out a new movie, even if it’s a great one, it continues to be compared to one of Batman’s greatest on-screen showings.</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=132 data-injectable=false>Enter one Reddit user who has torn back the curtain on this whole shadowy facade, and frankly, we’d like to thank them for it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Best DC movie since The Dark Knight you say?</a> from <a href=#>DC_Cinematic</a></figure><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>They can’t ALL be the best movie since The Dark Knight. Sure some of them might be pretty darn good, but most leave at least something to be desired. Plenty of cinephiles chimed in on the posting, and their responses have us cackling like the Joker.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=556 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>ClassicT4’s comment from discussion "Best DC movie since The Dark Knight you say?"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=176 data-injectable=false>It didn’t stop at just at the DCU.
