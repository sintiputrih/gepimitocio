Ben Flajnik's search for love hit a snag on Monday's episode of The Bachelor when he was blindsided by 26-year-old Casey's stunning admission that she still had feelings for an old boyfriend back home.
After Flajnik went on a group date led by a flirty, bikini-less Courtney and chose Rachel over Blakeley in an awkward two-on-one date, he was forced to make a snap decision as to Casey's fate on the show."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Arguing she was "completely in love" with her ex, Casey couldn't deal with the fact that he wouldn't marry her. "I broke up with him because he wasn't going to compromise and then we got back together. Maybe I should be in therapy," she reasoned.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When Casey spoke with Flajnik, he quickly dismissed her — and with good reason. "I wish you would have been more honest with me earlier on. There were women who I sent home who genuinely wanted to be here," Flajnik said. "I don't sugarcoat things and I think you should go home."</p><p>Flajnik's seven remaining bachelorettes went into the rose ceremony with mixed feelings. There was Courtney, who "was feeling pretty awesome," and then there was self-professed "prude" <strong>Jamie</strong>, who pulled out all the stops to seduce Flajnik at the last-minute cocktail party.</p><p>Up against <strong>Emily</strong> for the final rose, Jamie knew she didn't stand a chance, especially after her wacky PDA. "The funny thing about love is that I'm so scared of it, but it's the one thing that I want," she said, packing her bags. "I [tried] to be vulnerable and let him have me, but I don't think he thought that was cute."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2BjJucp2Wjmrulv4ycmKydqWK1sLnEZpifrJWneq2xwKuloqaXYsCpsdJmoKdlnKTDpnnWoquhZZGjvLW0xKtkppmeYn9xfZFwaWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-the-lakers-need-to-trade-for-stephen-curry.html><span>←</span><span>Why the Lakers Need to Trade for Stephen Curry</span></a>
