Following Shigeo Kageyama, a bland-looking middle schooler with amazing psychic powers, this anime series reached immense popularity over the years, conquering the hearts of viewers and critics alike. In fact, Mob Psycho 100 has collected a few awards for its action sequences and animation, often being listed as one of the best anime releases in recent years.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=691 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>Mob Psycho 100 started out as a manga series created by ONE, the same person responsible for creating <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Punch Man</a> – which most people can probably tell by the unique art style. The manga was first released in 2012 and continued being published weekly until 2017, amounting to 101 chapters compiled into 16 volumes. Before the manga reached its conclusion, though, an anime adaptation started being produced, and its first season aired in July of 2016. Right now, the anime has a total of 25 episodes — spanning over two seasons — two OVAs, and 6 special episodes; however, soon enough the episode count will go up, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fans will be graced with a third season</a> of their favorite series.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>With Mob Psycho 100 season three about to start, fans might want to rewatch the series in preparation, while others plan on watching it for the first time ever.
