While we don't know much about Stassie, we do know that we started seeing much more of her after the events that unfolded surrounding<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Khloe Kardashian</a> and Kylie's former BFF, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordyn Woods.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While we're certain everybody remembers what happened in that situation, there are still so many unanswered questions. Fans have pointed out that Kylie and Stassie have been friends for many years prior to the scandal erupting, and it turns out, they're right! Despite being in the picture for quite a while, who is Stassie&nbsp;Karanikolaou and how much is the star worth?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's Why Kylie Jenner's Personal Assistant Quit Her Job</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-stassie-karanikolaou>Who Is Stassie&nbsp;Karanikolaou?</h2><p>Stassie Karanikolaou has been part of the Kardashian and Jenner clan for longer than most of us think, however, the star is only recently gaining traction after being bumped up to the number one spot as Kylie Jenner's best friend. Kylie and former BFF, Jordyn Woods were like two peas in a pod, however, after the events involving Jordyn, Khloe, and Tristan Thompson transpired, Jordyn was mot only bullied by the family and their close friends but shunned from the Kar-Jenner group for good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after Jordyn Woods' unfortunate demise, Kylie Jenner began to post more and more photos onto her Instagram with Stassie. While many of us believe Stassie to be new to the group, the model and influencer has been part of Kylie's life since the two were reportedly 11-years-old. Considering Stassi grew up in the same environment as Kylie, it's no surprise that she is estimated to be<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> worth anywhere between $1 million - $5 million.&nbsp;</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Things Fans Probably Didn't Know About The Kardashians</a></span></p><p>Although Stassie is not a billionaire like her best friend, that does not seem to be an issue between the two whatsoever. Considering Kylie Jenner lives quite the lavish lifestyle, with an array of luxe cars, homes, and endless vacations, we can only assume that Stassie has the means in order to keep up with that type of lifestyle. The star began to gain notoriety back in 2013 when she started her Vine account. She would later grow even further on Instagram and create a YouTube channel that has half a million subscribers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star has done quite well for herself, however, fans continue to wonder whether Kylie foots the bill for Stassie or not. In a number of videos the duo post to their social platforms, it appears as if Stassie is oftentimes as Kylie's house so much that she might live there! While this was true at one point, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stassie has reportedly moved out of Kylie's</a> and purchased her very own home in the Hollywood Hills.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Then And Now</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecqyo6KdXZ%2Byr7rEq6pmmpaberTAwKyqop1doK6zrc2ioqikkaTCtHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./silver-plated-chalice-set-with-holy-communion-cup.html><span>←</span><span>Silver Plated Chalice Set with Holy Communion Cup 275 ml Blessed Celebration</span></a>
