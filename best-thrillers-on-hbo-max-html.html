Jonathan Mostow directs the always-great Kurt Russell as a man who has some words with a truck driver and learns that road rage is never the answer.

The story of a woman who basically stalks and terrorizes her weekend affair became a cautionary tale for an era dealing with changing views on sexuality and infidelity. Michael Douglas and Glenn Close were perfectly cast in a movie that doesn’t exactly hold up today in terms of its gender politics, but does serve as a fascinating snapshot of where these issues were in the mid-‘80s.

If you haven’t seen it since 2007, you may be surprised at how well it’s held up. The exact same film could be released today and it would have the same cultural impact.</p>No Country for Old Men <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>watch on hbo max</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl2t9t8pr00j13h6jbt0v2xw5@published>North by Northwest</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl2t9t6bk00is3h6jphw068ls@published data-word-count=6><strong>Year:</strong> 1959<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 2h 16m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Alfred Hitchcock</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl6qqiv4k00a13b6yqorxkybz@published data-word-count=68>Movies simply don’t get much better than Alfred Hitchcock’s thriller starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, and Martin Landau. Like so many Hitchcock classics, it’s a tale of mistaken identity, as Grant’s protagonist is chased across the country. The set pieces — like the infamous crop duster sequence — are well-known, but check out the complete picture, a perfectly paced and executed piece of refined filmmaking.</p>North by Northwest <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>watch on hbo max</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl2t9tbcg00jb3h6j7dc4sgtg@published>The Player</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl2t9t4to00ik3h6je1q93gsy@published data-word-count=6><strong>Year:</strong> 1992<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 2h 4m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Robert Altman</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl6qqizt700ap3b6yibhlg273@published data-word-count=76>After a rough patch in the ‘80s, Robert Altman came roaring back with a scathing Hollywood satire from the book by Michael Tolkin. Tim Robbins does his best film work as a studio executive who can’t decide if his biggest problem is at work or the writer sending him death threats. Altman’s skill with improvisational comedy and knowledge of the Hollywood machine blend to make a simply perfect movie, one of the best of the ‘90s.</p>The Player <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>watch on hbo max</a><p class=disclaimer-text data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/disclaimer-text/instances/cl6qn19rs001r3b6yvb2bjok2@published>All recommendations are made independently by our editors.
