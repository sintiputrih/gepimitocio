But it's mostly a rumor, because Cera does not share much info about her or their young son."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Here's everything we do know about Cera's wife, Nadine, so far.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">How did Michael Cera and his wife Nadine meet?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Cera did share some details about Nadine during a September 2022 interview on Justin Long's podcast <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow noopener" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://podcasts.apple.com/cy/podcast/michael-cera/id1459899327?i=1000579989838" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Life is Short" data-vars-ga-product-id=ccf05f02-db0a-4d9d-90d6-a48360b25056 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/cy/podcast/michael-cera/id1459899327?i=1000579989838" data-product-url="https://podcasts.apple.com/cy/podcast/michael-cera/id1459899327?i=1000579989838" data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-brand=podcasts.apple.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=eda67180-3594-49d1-afb7-4f518323cf38 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=podcasts.apple.com class="body-link product-links css-d2yypp ebsw2pb0">Life is Short</a>. He met her while he was on a press tour for Arrested Development and was sent to Paris with a buddy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“We went down the street one night to this little bar in Paris and she was there with all her flatmates, and we were smiling at each other in this very unabashed way,” he said. “There was no shyness, we just kept seeing each other and smiling. It was so comfortable. It was a really unfamiliar way to experience a stranger, and I felt like I saw the whole thing.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Nadine spoke English fluently and eventually the smiles progressed to speaking. They went on a coffee date the next day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“I went to Cannes a couple days later and while I was at Cannes I was like I think I should extend my trip and hang out with this woman ... so I was like ‘I'll do it! How romantic!’” he said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Then he discovered that Nadine was actually dating one of her roommates though it was “not official.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Cera bid her au revoir, but she broke it off with her roommate a few months later and reached out to him. In terms of timing, Cera was likely promoting the 2013 revival of Arrested Development. In 2014, he released a song referencing someone named Nadine, which is probably about his now-wife.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The song, titled “ohNadine (you were in my dream)” goes:</p>“Oh, Nadine / I can't help have a funny feeling you'd be good to me / You were in my dream/ Oh, Nadine / You once had a lovely dream / And woke with pain of loss / You looked at the sky / Lost in the darkness 'round the moon/ Oh, Nadine, I'll be there soon / Oh, Nadine, I'll be there.”<h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">When did Michael Cera and Nadine get married?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">In March 2018, the couple were <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/movies/is-michael-cera-married/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=seen class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">seen</a> wearing matching wedding bands, and shortly after <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-cera-is-married-see-his-wedding-ring/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Us Weekly" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">Us Weekly</a> confirmed they were married. Cera had been seen in a band as early as January 2017. They were just rarely spotted out together.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">Do Michael Cera and Nadine have any kids?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">In 2022, comedian Amy Schumer unceremoniously announced that the couple had welcomed a child in the fall of 2021. In a joint interview with Cera for Entertainment Tonight, she said, “Michael has a baby, too. Is that public knowledge? I just outed him, I just outed his baby.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">A couple days later, Cera <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/parents/michael-cera-shares-sex-and-age-of-his-baby/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=confirmed class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">confirmed</a> Schumer's outing to Extra, saying, “He's just a little 6-month-old baby.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">In February 2023, he told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/michael-cera-interview-barbie-david-lynch-fame-berlin-1235326540/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">The Hollywood Reporter</a> a little more, sharing how fatherhood has made life very different.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“I think the only thing that it affects is that you just want to spend as much time with them as possible,” Cera said. “So when I was 20, I would have been way happier to go off to some weird city and live in a hotel for three months. And when you have kids, you want to be with your family. And you miss them a lot.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">He said something similar while talking to Long on his podcast, mentioning how being in London for three months to shoot the Barbie movie was difficult.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“I think about him all day and look at pictures of him when I'm away from him,” Cera said.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">What does Nadine do?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Again, there's not much info. When they met, she was reportedly studying theater, but has since moved on to production.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prjLnmWcp51ksLa4066pnmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SudYCUcm1ucGNkxKm7jKKqZqWZmLWisctmmp6qkWLEqrLEZqWanJmjsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charli-xcx-lorde-girl-so-confusing-html.html><span>←</span><span>Which Pop Girl Is Girl, So Confusing About?</span></a>
