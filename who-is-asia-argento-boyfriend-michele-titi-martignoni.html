Over the pics, the two were vacationing at the sea, sharing smiles and hugs.</span></p><p><span>Prior to Asia, Michele dated the aspiring model, Yasmin @</span><a href=#><span>yasminels</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The two were together until 2021.</span></p><p><span>Michele once even featured his ex-girlfriend on his IG thanking her for everything she’s ever done for him. “Thank you my love for everything you have organized for me. Your closeness day after day gives me a great desire to win, and believe me I already have a lot of mine… with you (friends and fans) by my side I don’t stop more,” the caption read.</span></p><h3><b>Asia Argento Rela Love Life Before Michele Titi Martignoni</b></h3><p><span>Before Michele, Asia &nbsp; Argento dated the late Anthony Bourdain who was 20 years older than her.

However, their relationship wasn’t the one for the books.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to the actress, they both repeatedly cheated on one another and were both “ok” with it. “It wasn’t a problem for us. He was a man who traveled 265 days a year. We took great pleasure in each other’s company when we saw each other. But we are not children. We are grown-ups,” she explained.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, Anthony committed suicide in June 2018, right after the photos of Asia and French reporter Hugo Clement cozying up with each other surfaced online. Naturally, some claimed that Asia had murdered her boyfriend. To which, the actress explained, “People need to think that he killed himself for something like this? He had cheated on me too. It wasn’t a problem for us.”</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, Asia added that she was infact angry at Anthony for leaving “abandoning (her and her) kid.”</span></p><p><span>For those who don’t know, Asia has two children —&nbsp; Anna Lou (born in 2001 to Asia and her former partner, Italian musician Marco Castoldi), and Nicola Giovanni (born in 2008 to Asia and the film director Michele Civetta).</span></p><p><span>Sadly, Anna — who was named after Asia’s half-sister — tragically died in a motorcycle accident at the age of 21.</span></p><h3><b>Michele Titi Martignoni Age</b></h3><p><span>Michele Titi Martignoni was 26 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>He is 21 years younger than Asia Argento.</span></p><h3><b>Michele Titi Martignoni Family</b></h3><p><span>Michele Titi Martignoni comes from a family of five — his parents, himself, and his two siblings.</span></p><p><span>His father, Marco Martignoni @</span><a href=#><span>dr.marcomartignoni</span></a><span> is a </span><i><span>Boston University Henry M.
