When one fellow member of the bridal party broke into tears, the four-year-old royal reportedly swooped in to help her feel better, royal correspondents Emily Andrews and Omid Scobie revealed in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://onheir.podbean.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="On Heir" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">On Heir</a> podcast.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Two-year-old bridesmaid Zalie Warren apparently "had a bit of a meltdown" before the ceremony. "She started crying when they were waiting for Meghan," Andrews said. "It was only a couple of minutes. So Nanny Maria Borrallo kind of looked after her, and George apparently was trying to comfort her as well, which is very sweet."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It turns out, George's comforting skills worked. He, Zalie, and the rest of the bridal party nailed their entrance as they followed Markle down the aisle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Zalie is the goddaughter of Prince Harry and child of his close friends, Zoe Warren and Jake Warren. (Jake actually went to school with the groom and is the son of John Warren, the Queen's horse racing manager.) Though the toddler was caught in tears as nanny Borrallo carried her in St. George's Chapel, she pulled through for her big moment.</p><img alt="Event, Headpiece, Ceremony, Tradition, Wedding, Hair accessory, Headgear, Wedding dress, Bride, Bridal clothing, " title="Event, Headpiece, Ceremony, Tradition, Wedding, Hair accessory, Headgear, Wedding dress, Bride, Bridal clothing, " width=2385 height=1740 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-royal-wedding-crying-bridesmaid-1527188838.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prince George's little sister Princess Charlotte also played a big role in the bridal party during her uncle's wedding ceremony.
