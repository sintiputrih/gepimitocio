Its been in the works since 2007, and along the way it’s had some genuinely talented screenwriters associated with it, including Lawrence Kasdan (<i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>), but up until now there’s never been a director attached. It’s been ages since we’ve heard anything at all…until today. <i>Robotech</i> has found a director, and he’s…well, you’ve probably never heard of him, honestly.</p><p><a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> says that commercials director Nic Mathieu is in talks to take the gig. His commercial work is said to be very CGI-intensive, so he should have an edge when it comes to the over-the-top action you’d hope for out of a <i>Robotech</i> movie. He’s also attached to another big-screen science fiction project, David Koepp’s <i>The Wind</i>.</p><p>It’s common for a screenplay to bring in a new writer when a director comes on board, but there’s no word yet if that’s the plan for <i>Robotech</i>. Hopefully the project will keep its newfound momentum and actually make it to theaters a few years down the line. Maybe if <i>Pacific Rim</i> is a big hit this summer it can coast on Hollywood’s inevitable rush to greenlight every script with giant robots in it.<span id=more-44742></span></p><p>For those of you who didn’t grow up watching <i>Robotech</i> on Saturday mornings, here’s the synopsis from THR:</p><p>A sprawling sci-fi epic, <i>Robotech</i> takes place at a time when Earth has developed giant robots from the technology on an alien spacecraft that crashed on a South Pacific island. Mankind is forced to use the technology to fend off three successive waves of alien invasions. The first invasion concerns a battle with a race of giant warriors who seek to retrieve their flagship’s energy source known as “protoculture,” and the planet’s survival ends up in the hands of two young pilots.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irk56zqnvRqJmorJWYtW64yK%2BcmpuknryvecWio6ZllJ6%2Fpq%2FTqKlnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./everton-soares.html><span>←</span><span>Everton Soares Bio, Age, Net Worth, Married, Nationality, Facts</span></a>
