The publishers of Britain’s Daily Mail newspaper have agreed to pay the Duchess of Sussex a “significant” amount in damages after <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29325915/prince-harry-meghan-markle-legal-proceedings-daily-mail/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="publishing large portions of a private letter" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">publishing large portions of a private letter</a> she sent to her father, Thomas Markle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Court documents seen by BAZAAR.com show that Associated Newspapers will hand over an unspecified amount for infringing her copyright of the letter after they put the handwritten note on the front page of the Mail on Sunday and in several MailOnline articles in 2018. A small sum of £1 ($1.36) will also be transferred to Meghan for invading her privacy—a “nominal” sum that was agreed on by both parties to avoid a lengthy argument over the extent of damages the duchess has suffered.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In March 2021, a British High Court judge also ordered the tabloid publisher to cover a large portion of Meghan’s legal costs, which are now believed to be more than $2 million. A spokesperson for the duchess confirms to BAZAAR that the payout for copyright infringement is substantial and will be donated to an anti-bullying charity in due course.</p><img alt="meghan markle prince harry" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - September 23, 2021" width=891 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-duke-and-duchess-of-sussex-news-photo-1641414611.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Gotham</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As part of the court settlement revealed today, January 5, all Mail outlets have also been ordered to never disclose the names of Meghan’s five friends who anonymously spoke to People magazine for a 2019 cover feature about the royal. Last year, the publisher made it clear it wanted to name the individuals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The news follows the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline carrying <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a35749386/meghan-markle-apology-tabloid-printed-private-letter-father/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="court-ordered front-page and homepage legal notices" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">court-ordered front-page and homepage legal notices</a>, alongside a short report of the summary judgment, which was delivered to the paper by Judge Warby.
