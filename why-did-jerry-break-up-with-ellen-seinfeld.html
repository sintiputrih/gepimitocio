Because of this, fans can quote lines from the show and remember guest stars for their sometimes offbeat roles that helped move the storyline along.</p><p>While some of the guest stars were more forgettable than others or caused <a href=#>traumatizing moments behind the scenes and were never asked back again</a>, one that sticks out in the mind of viewers is Christine Taylor. This is because while she only lasted for two episodes on the show, characters and fans alike thought her character, Ellen, was the perfect girlfriend for <strong><a href=#>Jerry Seinfeld</a></strong>, among the <a href=#>sea of iconic girlfriends that portrayed Seinfeld's love interest</a> in the hit comedy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Sad Reason Jerry Seinfeld Struggles To Rewatch Seinfeld Reruns</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, even though Taylor was fresh off her fame of portraying Marcia Brady from The Brady Bunch Movie, which helped her to <a href=#>earn a massive net worth</a>, it was not enough to make her a recurring character on the show. As such fans to this day still cannot figure out why Jerry dumped Ellen as his girlfriend.</p><h2 id=christine-taylor-played-jerry-seinfeld-39-s-girlfriend-ellen>Christine Taylor Played Jerry Seinfeld's Girlfriend Ellen</h2><p>Taylor was not a novice when it came to playing guest-starring roles on sitcoms in the early to mid-1990s. Because of this, when the time came to audition for the role of Ellen on Seinfeld, it was not a part that was difficult to embrace.</p><p>After all, the character on paper looked to be totally normal. But this normalcy threw Seinfeld's character, Jerry, and as a result, comedy ensued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52454409.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike many of Jerry's girlfriends, Ellen was very normal. The only hiccup came when she admitted on their first date that it was her birthday. This piece of information threw Jerry because it was confusing why she would choose to spend it with a virtual stranger rather than friends and family.</p><p>Additionally, when Jerry introduced Ellen to his parents, they adored her. This left Jerry perplexed about his opinion of Ellen. An opinion that got even more convoluted when two of Ellen's friends thanked Jerry for what he was doing for Ellen but did not give context to the statement.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Patrick Warburton Wanted Nothing To Do With Jerry Seinfeld During His Guest-Starring Role On The Sitcom</a></span></p><p>While Ellen was beautiful and lovely, Jerry broke up with her after two episodes, which was unfortunate, given that Taylor did so well on her audition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christine-taylor-39-s-audition-went-well-but-it-didn-39-t-end-great>Christine Taylor's Audition Went Well, But It Didn't End Great</h2><p>Before Taylor was cast as Ellen on Seinfeld, she was an up-and-coming star after her starring role as Marcia Brady. But this did not stop <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor from having nerves before an audition</a> with casting agents and Seinfeld himself for the show.</p><p>"Even getting the audition and knowing that you're going to read with Jerry and the writers was so nerve-wracking," Taylor explained. "As an actress, you just kind of get a parking pass that is like a mile away and then you walk that sort of scary walk of going over your lines."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar49732768.png><p>Fortunately, the audition could not have gone better. But it is what happened after the audition that made for a memorable experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I remember going to the audition. They were so nice," Taylor said of Seinfeld and others at the audition.</p><p>"I did really well. And as I walked out and was leaving I had to go down a staircase to leave, and I missed the first step. Thank God I didn't tumble down the entire staircase. But what I did do was break the heel on one of my shoes. So I had to walk a mile back to my car with only one heel on my shoe. So it was like this embarrassing horrible limp."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Kristin Davis Really Felt About Working With Jerry Seinfeld On Seinfeld</a></span></p><p>With all going so well during the audition and the fact that fans of the show loved Taylor and her character, Ellen, it still perplexes some as to why Ellen did not stick around longer. Because of this, the discussion is still alive and well as to why Jerry broke up with Ellen among fans today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-jerry-break-up-with-ellen-on-seinfeld>Why Did Jerry Break Up With Ellen On Seinfeld?</h2><p>With Ellen seemingly being the perfect girl, it does not make sense as to why Jerry would have dumped her. But nearly 30 years later, fans are still trying to come up with reasons why Ellen did not get very far with Jerry and why he eventually dumped her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/88b622e0f4e43f4570485ead6145137c.png><p>Many fans have even asked Christine herself why Jerry made what they thought was a boneheaded move. It was when Jerry's parents met Ellen that, according to Taylor, the romance was over.</p><p>"As soon as his parents gave him the thumbs of approval, for me, that was when he broke up with me," Taylor stated. "If it passes the parent test then he can't stay with her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There will never be an explanation as to why Jerry dumped Ellen. That is part of the fun of Seinfeld, however, and why the show continues to be a success in syndication, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bringing Seinfeld $400 million per syndication cycle</a>, nearly 35 years after it first aired.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecmeqauxXZe%2Fpq3KZqypZaeewal5xKWjnqZdqLKqusWeo51n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./civ5-best-civs-leaders.html><span>←</span><span>Best Leaders &amp;amp; Civilizations For Each Victory Type FandomSpot</span></a>
