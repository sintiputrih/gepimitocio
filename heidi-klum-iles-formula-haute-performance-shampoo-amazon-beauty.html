No matter how she chooses to style her locks, they always look healthy, shiny and totally luscious! That’s why whenever the supermodel and America’s Got Talent judge, 48, shares her beauty secrets, we start taking notes the second she addresses <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">her haircare routine</a>.</p><p>In fact, we just revisited an interview she did <a href=# rel=noopener>with Harper’s Bazaar UK</a>, and discovered <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">her go-to shampoo</a>. It’s been her secret weapon since discovering the product in London years ago, so we immediately investigated what makes it so special.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Iles-Formula-Haute-Performance-Shampoo.jpg><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Iles Formula – Haute Performance Shampoo</a> with free shipping at Amazon!&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p>The <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Haute Performance Shampoo</a> from Iles Formula is said to be packed with a variety of amazing antioxidants that not only leave your hair clean, but nourish it to make it feel incredible. Klum revealed that longtime hairstylist <strong>Wendy Iles</strong> gave her a sample of the shampoo while on a trip across the pond, and she promptly “washed [her] hair and loved the way it looked.” After gushing to Iles about the product, she found it was from the stylist’s own line!</p><p>Until trying this particular shampoo, Klum realized she hadn’t been paying attention to the “texture” and value <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">a shampoo can give</a>. It reportedly helps to detangle your hair, repair broken strands and provide jaw-dropping volume and body! Klum made a point to state that she truly notices a difference when she has to use another brand. This just might be the real deal!</p><p><strong>Why We Love It:</strong></p><ul><li>The shampoo works for all ages and deeply nourishes without creating dryness.</li><li>Sensitive Skin? No worries, this product works on even the most sensitive skin types without irritation.</li><li>Nothing Dirty: No Sulfates. No Silicones. No Parabens</li><li>Reviewers Say: “Soft”! Multiple reviews point out how noticeably softer hair is with this shampoo.</li></ul><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Iles Formula – Haute Performance Shampoo</a> with free shipping at Amazon!&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">This shampoo</a> may be on the pricier side compared to drugstore staples, but if it potentially has the power to leave our locks looking half as radiant as Klum’s, we’re willing to shell out the extra money. Reviewers claim that this shampoo is completely worth it and appreciate the delicate formula. Considering the enthusiastic feedback and Klum’s stamp of approval, we’re confident this could be what your hair has been looking for!</p><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Iles Formula – Haute Performance Shampoo</a> with free shipping at Amazon!&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><strong>Not what you’re looking for?
