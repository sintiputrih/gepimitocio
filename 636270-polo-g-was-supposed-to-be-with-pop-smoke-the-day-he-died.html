The craziest thing, I worked with him right before he passed," Polo further shared. "I was in the studio with him. He said he was leaving to L.A. I stayed in New York an extra day to make sure Fivio [Foreign] laid his verse [for 'Clueless']. And Pop, a contact was telling me Pop wanted to get in the stu in L.A. the night he passed. ‘Cause I live there, he live there.

Polo recalls Pop getting through the session fairly quickly. The late rapper even paid homage to Chicago by asking Polo for the name of a popular spot in the city.
