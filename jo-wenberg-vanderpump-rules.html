In response to a post made on an Instagram fan page, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Vanderpump</a>, Katie made several shocking statements about Jo.</p><p>“Her energy is on par with a crack head,” Katie wrote (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>). The reality star went on to call Jo a "psycho," before suggesting she would “light her on fire with Raquel [Leviss].”</p><p>Tom and Jo have yet to publicly respond to Katie’s remarks. However, the drama will likely come to a boil during the <a href=#>Season 10 reunion</a>, which is set to air to begin filming on March 23. And while Jo has not confirmed whether she will be in attendance, Tom will undoubtedly appear alongside the show’s main cast members.</p><p>Watch new episodes of Vanderpump Rules Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7xuw8SnmZ6ql2LDorrDnqmprZ2lerPBy56q</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-actor-in-the-new-buick-commercial-is-more-famous-than-you-realize.html><span>←</span><span>The Actor In The New Buick Commercial Is More Famous Than You Realize</span></a>
