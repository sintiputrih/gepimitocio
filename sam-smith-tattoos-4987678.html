While some fans couldn’t seem to get enough of the club banger, others weren’t so happy with Sam’s performance of it at the Capital’s Jingle Bell Ball in London, as their <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>glittery jumpsuit</a> caused a bit of backlash, including “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fat shaming</a>.” The “On My Mind” hitmaker received an outpouring of support at the time, as true fans know Sam has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>struggled with their body image and gender</a> over a lifetime, coming out as “non-binary” in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sam-smith-tattoo-left-shoulder-kissing-couple-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Since the announcement, Sam has often made note on their <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> about their journey to self-love, which includes embracing their body, and its art. The Grammy winner recently revealed on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Jennifer Hudson Show</a> that they have around 35 tattoos! When asked how they choose which image to get burned into their skin, Sam said that they pick them out randomly! “I’m a bit reckless, on the day of, I’m like, ‘Just do it,'” they explained, before joking, ‘Cause I’ve got so many bad ones I just don’t care anymore.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Keep reading to find out more about Sam’s collection of tattoos, below!</p><h2>Finger rings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sam-smith-tattoo-left-hand-equal-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Sam revealed that their very first tattoos were placed on both of their index fingers. “I never planned to be a tattoo person actually,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>British GQ</a> in November 2022. “I got these two when i was 17,” they added while holding up their index fingers, which featured two diamond rings inked on them. “I think I probably have nearly 30 now because I’m enjoying the coverage.”</p><h2>“Alone”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>While speaking with <strong>Jennifer Hudson</strong>, Sam admitted their least favorite tattoo is the image of the word “alone” plastered to their right bicep. On Instagram, they explained, “This is just me being a melancholy t**t. Hah. I do see it as a small positive though… No longer lonely… Just alone… Which is ok x. Thought I’d share these with you because I love them.”</p><h2>Kissing Couple</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Sam has an outline image of what appears to be<strong> James Dean</strong> and <strong>Marlon Brando</strong> kissing. The body art is on their left shoulder and would seem to indicate their fight for LGBTQ+ equality.</p><h2>Standing in mirror</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sam-smith-tattoo-right-arm-portrai-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>After Sam let the world know that they identify as “non-binary,” a tattoo was in order to celebrate! Sam had an incredible cartoon image of a boy looking into a full-length mirror while wearing only underwear and high heels. The tattoo was inked by artist <strong>Miles Langford</strong> on April 22, 2021, according to their Instagram.</p><h2>Equal sign</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Sam took to their Instagram to show off their equal signs tattooed on their ring finger, which represents the fight for marriage equality. Sharing a snap of the body art, Sam wrote, “This one is pretty self-explanatory. It shows my views on gay marriage and equality for all.”</p><h2>Bird & Urdu</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sam-smith-tattoo-left-inner-arm-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>A gorgeous image of a black bird is inked on the British heartthrob’s left forearm. A word in the Urdu Language is placed next to the bird according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BodyArtGuru</a>. The outlet reported that the bird is a symbol of courage and freedom.</p><h2>The letter ‘B’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>On their index finger, Sam has the letter “B” tattooed. BodyArtGuru claims the letter stands for Sam’s former partner <strong>Brandon Flynn</strong>, as Sam is now reportedly&nbsp;in a relationship with<strong>&nbsp;Francois Rocci</strong>.</p><h2>Red pumps</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Sam has a cute image of red high heels inked near their left wrist. It would appear to be an homage to one of their favorite accessories. “I feel just as much woman as I am man. I got teased for it. But there were also people respecting me for walking around like that in my school,” they told the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Evening Standard</a> in 2017. “I just buy everything, heels, dresses. I love a heel. I’ve got loads of heels at home.”</p><h2>Pete’s Dragon</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Sam showed off his love for one of Disney’s classic movies. The singer had the cartoon dragon Elliot from 1977’s Pete’s Dragon.</p><h2>Puffer fish</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>During their visit to The Jennifer Hudson Show in November 2022, Sam revealed their most recent body ink. The performer said they had a “puffer fish” on their left forearm. “I like when the tattoos look a bit masculine, but they actually have nice friendly undertones,” he told the host.</p><h2>Spitfire plane</h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>Also on the talk show, Sam explained how they ended up with a “weird” tattoo shortly after their first two ones on their index fingers. “Then I got one on my ankle,” they told Jennifer. “I got a really weird one, a Spitfire plane, I dunno why. When I was drunk in Malia.”</p><h2>Upcoming Tattoo Plans</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>Lastly, on the same talk show, Sam told Jennifer that they will be brave enough to get a face tattoo when they are much older…but they will keep it at a respectable size. “Then when I’m 80, I’ll get a huge one on my face,” Sam quipped.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9KapGarnZ7BqXnTmqutp5%2BoenWFl3BtcHBf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./naya-riveras-revelations-abortion-sex-drugs-on-glee-set-w439289.html><span>←</span><span>Naya Riveras Revelations: Abortion, Sex, Drugs on 'Glee' Set</span></a>
