However, before getting to know his kids, let’s know a little something about him. Mario exchanged vows with his beau <strong>Courtney Lopez</strong> on the 1st of December 2012 and are still going strong.</p><p>Together the couple is proud parents of three gorgeous children, two sons named <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Dominic Lopez </strong></a>& <strong>Santino Rafael Lopez</strong> and a daughter named Gia Francesca Lopez. His daughter Gia is the oldest amongst the kids, and oh boy, she is lovely, just like her mother. In fact, she has inherited both of her parents’ good looks and their charming nature. That said, let’s get to know more about Mario Lopez’s daughter Gia Lopez.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=His_First_Born_and_Only_Daughter></span>His First Born and Only Daughter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born on September 11, 2010, in Burbank, California, Gia Lopez is the eldest child of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Mario</a> and Courtney Lopez. At the time of her birth, she weighed six pounds and four ounces. Father Mario and mother Courtney were overjoyed when they first saw their daughter, and the lovely pair said that they will cherish that very moment for the rest of their lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mario-Lopez-with-daughter-Gia.jpg><p>Being the only daughter, Mario shares a special bond with her. He is a really cool dad who loves to have fun with his children. We can see the family of five enjoying their<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> time on Tv shows</a> and the red carpet. Being a celebrity’s daughter, Gia has got the opportunity to meet various big shots of Hollywood like <strong>Dwane Johnson</strong>, <strong>Brad Pitt</strong>, <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio,</strong> and many more. Plus, little Gia sometimes<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> steals the show</a> as she takes interviews of the actor at the red carpet.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>A post shared by Mario Lopez (@mariolopez)</a> on Oct 4, 2019 at 7:03pm PDT</p><p>Mario is most of the time accompanied by his better-half but, on special occasions, he brings his kids alongside him. Especially his daughter, father Mario spends a<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> chunk of his free time with his daughter Gia</a>. The father-daughter duo loves spending time with one another. Father Mario also joined his daughter on one of her school’s program, and the two of them had a fun time <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">dancing together</a>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Very_Talented_Daughter></span>A Very Talented Daughter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Even before she could talk properly, Mario’s daughter made her movie debut as a Tick or Treat Kid in a short movie, The Disappointment of Jonathan Bender. Later on, she voiced Estrella and Young Marisa in the popular TV series Elena of Avalor. If that wasn’t enough to prove she is a talented kid, then you must know she is a gold medalist in gymnastics.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Proud of my GiGi!<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#DaddysGirl</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/MpkytOZ6tg</a></p><p>— Mario Lopez (@mariolopezviva) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">February 23, 2020</a></p><p>Mario Lopez’s daughter Gia Francesca Lopez often referred to as Gigi, is a wonderful gymnast. Her father is her biggest fan and has uploaded tons of <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pictures and videos</a> of his daughter, simply mentioning how proud he is of his baby girl.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Responsible_Daughter></span>A Responsible Daughter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Being the eldest, Gigi is also the most responsible one. She loves looking after her brothers when her parents are not around. She also shares a special bond with her younger sibling. Her bond clearly reflects from the pictures her father uploads on his Instagram account.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mario-Lopez-kids.jpg><p>In addition to that, she adores playing with her brothers, not only that, she also teaches her younger brother Nico how to play the piano. Well, they adore one another’s company, and their parents are really proud of how their relationship with one another grows deeper day after day.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Lovely_Family></span>A Lovely Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The key to a child’s kind and generous nature is a good family. If parents teach you good manners while you are young, then that sticks with you till the end of time. So, it’s obvious where Gigi’s kind nature has come from. She has a lovely family, and we are sure she loves them as much as they love her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mario-Lopez-with-family.jpg><p>Father Mario and mother Courtney just adore spending time with their kids. Gigi is a huge fan of Frozen 2 so, her father got her <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Frozen 2 pop Adventures playset</a>, and we can see them having fun playing with that too. Plus, father Mario takes her to watch movies too, and the father-daughter duo is usually accompanied by either mother Courtney or brother Nico.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mario-Lopez-with-kids.jpg><p>To conclude, Gigi is a wonderful and brilliant daughter who loves spending time having fun with her family and friends. She is her father’s little princess and a mother figure to her brothers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Gia_Francesca_Lopez_Name_Meaning></span>Gia Francesca Lopez Name Meaning<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mario Lopez’s daughter Gia Francesca Lopez’s first name Gia is a short form of Gianna, which means God’s gracious gift.
