On the floor,” to which Justin replied, “Ur jaw is other places too lets be honest.” The model then begged her husband to “please go to sleep.”</p><p>The “Love Yourself” singer is no stranger to talking about his sex life. In January, he confirmed suspicions that <a href=#>his comeback single “Yummy” is about Hailey</a>, telling <a href=#><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a>, “It is what it is, right? I’m married!” One month later, he told fans during a Q&A in London that he and the Drop the Mic cohost “like to Netflix and chill, but we definitely do more of the chilling,” adding, “It <a href=#>gets pretty crazy</a>. That’s all we do.”</p><p>That was not always the case for the couple, however. In their March 2019 Vogue cover story, the Biebers revealed that they had <a href=#>waited until marriage to have sex</a>.</p><p>“I think sex can cause a lot of pain. Sometimes people have sex because they don’t feel good enough. Because they lack self-worth. Women do that, and guys do that,” Hailey said at the time. “I wanted to rededicate myself to God in that way because I really felt it was better for the condition of my soul.”</p><p>Justin, for his part, admitted to the magazine that he <a href=#>had “a legitimate problem with sex”</a> before his union with the TV personality.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Canada native and Hailey dated from 2015 to 2016 before he rekindled his on-off romance with <a href=#><strong>Selena Gomez</strong></a>. Just months after Justin and the “Rare” singer, 28, <a href=#>split for good</a> in 2018, he <a href=#>proposed to Hailey</a>. They <a href=#>married at a New York City courthouse</a> that September and <a href=#>held a second ceremony</a> in South Carolina the following year with family and friends.</p><p>Earlier this month, Justin explained on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that while he “wants to have a few children,” he and Hailey are <a href=#>waiting until she is ready</a>.</p><p>“I think Hailey still has some things she wants to accomplish as a woman,” he said. “And I think that’s OK.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajraOptq95waKcm52iYrqit8SsZKerlqx6pLvMppynrF2Wr7DB02afmqGcmsZursClm7Chnqh6q63WaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-get-autographs-at-a-basketball-game-in-2024-a-step-by-step-guide.html><span>←</span><span>How to Get Autographs at a Basketball Game in 2024: A Step by Step Guide</span></a>
