Former Phoenix Suns guard Tyler Ulis was attacked by two individuals for holding up an elevator because his friend was trailing by a few about a few paces. That friend happened to be former Kentucky&nbsp;& Phoenix Suns' teammate Devin Booker,&nbsp;who came out swinging in his defence. But before we get to that, lets <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">run it down</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The leaked footage is postdated by about a few months (May 26, 2017), from back when Tyler Ulis was still a contracted member of the Suns' organization. Unfortunately Ulis was a casualty of circumstance yet again, as Suns's management waived his rights on June 30th, thus deeming him expendable.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Tyler and then-teammate Devin Booker were in Tempe, Arizona in an apartment complex when Ulis harmlessly tried holding the elevator doors for his friend. A few individuals, seemingly in a hurry quickly resorted to violence in lieu of voicing their objections. One of the individuals then gained a physical advantage, putting Ulis in a headlock.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">We're lead to believe Devin Booker played some part in alleviating the tension because moments later he could be seen riding reentering the elevator with Ulis by his side. Footage of Devin Booker's intervention remains undiscovered, because the scuffle had broken out into the hallway&nbsp;away from cameras depicting the action.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhZ4VxfI9mqq6mo2KxpsLIp2Sbp5%2BgsrN5wKebZqypobKzedSloKxloKe8t7vKnptmoZ5isq2x1ZqrqKpdl7KiwMOorqdlp5bBpLSMp5ywqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./85425-rory-gilmores-hair-evolution-on-gilmore-girls-was-so-much-more-than-just-a-series-of.html><span>←</span><span>Rory Gilmore's Hair Evolution On 'Gilmore Girls' Was So Much More Than Just A Series Of Haircuts</span></a>
