The lovebirds took some time off from working in their Laurel storefront in January 2023 for a very sweet reason — to prepare for the arrival of their little boy, Hank Howard Napier.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I can’t imagine having children anywhere other than Laurel,” the dad of two reflected on Instagram after the birth of his son. “Our friends and family have really showed out.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkeqOxzWalmqiZmr%2B0ecGrpq2glad6q7HSrJxmpJmbsm7Bz52YrZ1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sauce-walka-net-worth-father-wife-brother-height.html><span>←</span><span>Get To Know Sauce Walka Net Worth, Father, Wife, Brother, Height</span></a>
