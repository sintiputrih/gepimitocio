It’s hard to feel comfortable when you feel like everyone is watching, judging and commenting on the way you look,” she told Glamour UK in February 2022. “Self confidence is still something I work on daily, but when I stopped trying to conform to society’s unrealistic standards of beauty, my perspective entirely shifted.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see more of Gomez’s most inspiring quotes about body positivity:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkwKa4xKeYZp%2BforK7v4ympqysXZq6sbvWnqmippdivra7056qZpmSpMK1ecGom7JloKTAqsDIr6CtsV2kw6a%2BjK2fnmWpmq6zv4yiZJqlXaWys7LEnKtmrJiaerit2GagZpmdZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./samaira-rao-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-330794-html.html><span>←</span><span>Samaira Rao Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
