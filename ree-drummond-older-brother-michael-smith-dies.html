"He was seventeen months older than me, my first friend and buddy, and I'm so grateful for over 50 years of photos and memories."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also shared a series of photos with her post, including two sweet snaps of the two of them together when they were children, and another of Michael taken as an adult.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For more on Ree Drummond and other top stories, listen below to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day</a>.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Please pray for my parents, whose devotion to Mike was boundless, and who will feel this loss most acutely," Drummond added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Michael Smith, you were everything," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Betsey Smith, Drummond and Michael's sister, also honored her late brother on social media.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We lost Michael, my sweet and wonderful brother, this last weekend," Betsey wrote in the caption of an Instagram post. "He was one of a kind, and he will be missed by so many people who loved him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm very thankful for his life, the connections he made and his caring, fun and independent spirit," added Betsey, whose post included a shot of her and Michael posing together when they were kids. "Love you forever, Mikey."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Drummond previously featured her brother on a 2012 installment of her Food Network series, an episode she called her "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>favorite, for obvious reasons</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She opened up about Michael in her 2011 book, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Pioneer Woman: Black Heels to Tractor Wheels</a>, explaining that he had "developmental disabilities."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They didn't appear to stop him from living life, especially in his hometown of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, where longtime pal Dan Dalton said Mikey (as his friends called him) was a "Bartlesville icon" with a smile no one could ignore.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Mikey made a very big impression on everybody in Barlesville</a>. He was liked by everybody. Everybody knew him," Dalton told KTUL. "He met friends everywhere he went. He went to all the basketball games, all the football games, all the baseball games — not to really watch the games, but to connect with people."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dalton and Michael — an Ambulance Service administrator — were friends for 40 years, meeting when Michael was just 14 years old.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He would routinely visit the ambulance station, the fire stations," Dalton told the outlet. "He'd help us wash cars, clean the ambulances, restock the ambulances, whatever he could do. ... He had uniforms and hats from almost every station that he visited."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We went out to dinner several times, even went on trips together. He became a very close friend," Dalton added. "Everybody he met was a friend. He knew their phone numbers, he kept contact with them almost every day. He had an amazing ability to remember people's phone numbers."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A cause of death was not given for Michael, though Dalton wrote on social media that his friend "went fast and did not suffer."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"God has been very good to my favorite buddy," Dalton wrote.
