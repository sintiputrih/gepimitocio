Fortunately, if one of your neighboring civilizations does declare war on yours, you can restore peace by parleying with your would-be conquerors. Here’s a breakdown of how to <strong>parley</strong> with hostile nations in <a href=#>Dwarf Fortress</a>.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Dwarf Fortress – How to Parley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Dwarf-Fortress-Parley.jpg><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=765 data-injectable=true>While starvation, dehydration, <a href=#>or alcohol deprivation</a> are the most persistent long-term threats to your fortress’ survival, it will likely be <strong>sieged by a rival nation</strong> at one point or another. The most common orchestrators of a siege are <strong>Goblins</strong>, who will regularly assault your fortress <strong>without provocation</strong>. However, <strong>Humans and Elves</strong> may siege your fortress if the dwarves under its banner regularly <strong>attack their caravans</strong> and <strong>kill or imprison their diplomats</strong>.</p><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>If you aren’t confident that your fortress’s defenses can withstand the siege heading your way, you can try to sue for peace by <strong>parleying with the invading nation</strong>. Alternatively, invaders who’ve repeatedly failed to conquer your fortress <strong>may try to parley with you</strong> to end the bloodshed. Regardless of which side initiates the negotiations, the price for a ceasefire is always a <strong>Legendary Artifact</strong>.</p><p data-characters=45 data-current-count=45 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>How to Make a Well in Dwarf Fortress</a></p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>Crafted by one of your fortress’ citizens <strong>once in their lifetime</strong>, Legendary Artifacts are valuable objects that are seen as physical embodiments of their makers’ very souls. After both sides have accepted the terms of the <strong>parley</strong>, your fortress’s leader must <strong>put the Legendary Artifact in their inventory</strong> and bring it to the enemy’s forces. Be sure to <strong>click the hammer and lock icon</strong> to prioritize the task, or your leader could waste valuable time focusing on other endeavors.</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>If all goes as planned, <strong>the enemy will peacefully withdraw</strong> after the <strong>Legendary Artifact</strong> has traded hands. However, while parleying can be a surefire way to save your fortress from being wiped out by a more-powerful nation in the early game, it’s important to remember that it’s not an optimal long-term solution. Not only is the <strong>Legendary Artifact</strong> bartered in a <strong>parley</strong> lost forever, but the peace it buys is only temporary.</p><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=false>To ensure that you don’t find yourself trading <strong>Legendary Artifacts</strong> to every invading army that crosses your border, it’s essential to focus on <a href=#>strengthening your fortress’s defenses</a> <strong>by constructing a Barracks building</strong> and training a militia that can defend it against persistent aggressors. Alternatively, you can strive to build a better relationship with your more-agreeable neighbors by establishing trade agreements and treating non-dwarven visitors with respect.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
