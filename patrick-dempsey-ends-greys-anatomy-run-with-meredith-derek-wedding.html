Before she officially left the beach, however, Meredith and Derek<a href=#> finally had a traditional wedding moment.</a></p><p>The iconic onscreen couple <a href=#>previously handed over their church nuptials</a> to <a href=#>Alex Karev (<strong>Justin Chambers</strong>) and Izzie Stevens (<strong>Katherine Heigl</strong>)</a> during season 5 when the latter was fighting cancer. Meredith and Derek, meanwhile, opted to exchange vows via a Post-it note, making their union legal at a courthouse years later in order to adopt daughter Zola.</p><p>“Ellis draws this picture of us,” Meredith told Derek on Thursday’s episode, referring to their youngest daughter. “I’m in a wedding dress, you’re in a suit. I show her the Post-it note, but she just … hates it. She feels robbed.”</p><p>While Derek noted that his wife “hates weddings,” the characters changed into the clothes from the picture.</p><p>“I hate weddings, but I’d give this to her if I could,” Meredith said. “What do you want me to promise?”</p><p>The late neurosurgeon replied, “To torture yourself less.”</p><p>While Meredith nearly went in to kiss Derek, she blurted out, “I don’t want to leave the kids,” to which he responded, “I don’t want you to leave the kids.”</p><p>When they later changed one last embrace, Derek said, “You have to go. It’s not your time yet. Our kids need you. You have to go.”</p><p><a href=#>Grey’s Anatomy fans have been emotional since Derek’s surprising</a> return in the season 17 premiere, which aired in November 2020, but nothing has wrecked the fandom like Thursday’s episode.</p><p>“MEREDITH SAYING ‘WE LOVE YOU. WE LOVE YOU. WE LOVE ZOZO’ BECAUSE HER AND DEREK GAVE UP ON BEING TOGETHER FOR THEIR KIDS I AM GOING TO DYING. #GreysAnatomy,” one fan <a href=#>tweeted</a>.</p><p>Another viewer <a href=#>wrote</a>, “I’ll forever cry at Meredith and Derek beach moments #GreysAnatomy.”</p><p>A third <a href=#>tweeted</a> a photo of Sandra Oh’s Cristina Yang saying, “Somebody sedate me,” adding, “Apr 23. the day derek died. merder’s beach wedding. the day derek left again. the day mer woke up. #GreysAnatomy.”</p><p>“GIVE ME A DAMN SECOND #GreysAnatomy,” a fourth viewer <a href=#>concluded</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Grey’s Anatomy airs on ABC Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET — with<a href=#><strong> Sarah Drew</strong>’s highly-anticipated return and character April’s reunion with Jackson (<strong>Jesse Williams</strong></a>) slated to bring fans to tears once again on the May 6 episode.</p><p>Scroll through to see photos from Meredith and Derek’s wedding moment:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BlrrW%2ByJyiZpyVor20sdhmnKeco2K0s7HYrGSappGpvK7FjKusp2WnnsGpecyeqZ6cmam1brDEq5ykZaeasaW1zaBm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./417259-fans-injured-at-lovers-and-friends-festival-after-alleged-gunshots-were-heard-news.html><span>←</span><span>Fans Injured At Lovers &amp;amp; Friends Festival After Alleged Gunshots Were Heard</span></a>
