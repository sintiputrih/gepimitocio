They didn't really give a reason for this decision, but it's likely that it is related to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes.</p><p>Originally, it was supposed to be released on March 22, 2024, but the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Puck newsletter</a> said a source suggested otherwise.</p><p>With the film in the middle of production when the strikes began, it likely isn't finished.
