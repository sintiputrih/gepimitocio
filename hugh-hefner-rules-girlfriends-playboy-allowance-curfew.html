Some people use their talent, some use their brains, and others use their lifestyle as a way of getting people to take notice of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Hugh Hefner</a> was a public figure who was once one of the most famous men in the world. Hefner used <a href=#>Playboy</a> and his lifestyle to become an infamous figure, selling the dream of luxury to all. In recent years, his <a href=#>former partners</a> have come forward to reveal some of the hidden things about his relationships with them.</p><p>Let's hear what they had to say about Hefner, namely his rules for them.</p><h2 id=hugh-hefner-was-a-media-mogul>Hugh Hefner Was A Media Mogul</h2><p>In the history of pop culture, there have been a number of figures who have come along and who have made a name for themselves by being over-the-top and genuinely interesting to the public. One such figure was Hugh Hefner, who used his lifestyle and the success of Playboy to become one of the most infamous figures in history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hefner did an outstanding job of turning Playboy into a global brand that everyone wanted a piece of. It's a different age now, but for decades, Playboy was the magazine that everyone wanted to be in, even if it meant showing a little more than some would have liked. Let's just put it this way, if a celebrity did a Playboy shoot, it was a massive deal.</p><p>Throughout his life, Hugh Hefner did things his way, and he lived his life to the fullest. Nothing was off limits for Hefner, and his iconic Playboy Mansion was a Wonderland for the rich and famous looking to have a good time away from night club scene in Hollywood.</p><p>Eventually, Hefner got a reality show off the ground that spent time showing off his girlfriends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Hugh Hefner Really Regretted Donald Trump's Playboy Cover</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hugh-hefner-39-s-girlfriends-were-highlighted-on-39-the-girls-next-door-39>Hugh Hefner's Girlfriends Were Highlighted On 'The Girls Next Door'</h2><p>Back in 2005, during an era of reality TV where seemingly nothing was off-limits, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Girls Next Door</a> made its debut on the E! Channel. Starring Hugh Hefner and his trio of girlfriends, the show was meant to shine a light on the girls and their life in the Playboy Mansion.</p><p>Holly Madison, Kendra Wilkinson, and Bridget Marquardt were the primary stars of the show, though others came as the series went on. Fans got a glimpse into their lifestyle and their partying ways, and the show did a great job of making everything seem like it was virtually a dream come true for everyone involved.</p><p>If there was one thing that Hugh Hefner was truly brilliant with, it was selling his lifestyle, and The Girls Next Door was a large advertising campaign about what life could be like for those lucky enough to link up with the notorious Hef.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite everything seeming fun and light on the surface, there was a lot more going on behind the scenes than most were anticipating. Over time, a number of things have been revealed, including some of the rules that Hugh Hefner had in place for the women that he considered his girlfriends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Money Did Sarah Michelle Gellar Turn Down From Playboy?</a></span></p><h2 id=an-allowance-curfew-and-no-red-lipstick-were-just-some-of-hefner-39-s-weird-rules-for-his-girlfriends>An Allowance, Curfew And No Red Lipstick Were Just Some Of Hefner's Weird Rules For His Girlfriends</h2><p>So, what were some of the rules that Hugh Hefner had for his partners? Well, some are a bit too explicit to share, but some of the tamer ones include being tracked at all times and even an allowance that was used as leverage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grunge</a>, "There were plenty of other rules: no red lipstick, no social media, a 9 p.m. curfew, and no inviting boys in the mansion."</p><p>The site also noted that "According to cast member Kendra Wilkinson, Playboy staffers would use a book to keep tabs on when the women left the mansion and returned every day (via New York Daily News). Hefner would read the book every morning."</p><p>Izabella St. James, a former girlfriend of Hefner's, talked about the weekly allowance and how it was a time for Hefner to offer feedback and criticism.</p><p>"Most of the complaints were about the lack of harmony among the girlfriends — or your lack of sexual participation in the 'parties' he held in his bedroom," she wrote in her autobiography.</p><p>These rules don't seem like a whole lot of fun, and we can only imagine what it was actually like to live this way. Yes, these women were offered luxuries, but they also dealt with some stuff that clearly affected them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Playboy Playmate Said Living With Hugh Hefner Was 'Very Cult-Like'</a></span></p><p>Living at the Playboy Mansion wasn't always living on easy street, and these women made sure to keep their receipts.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's What Kendra Wilkinson's Life Looks Like Years After Leaving The Playboy Mansion</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifrp%2BYYrWmss2eqWaqpaGytHnGoqmlnqKesq%2Bw0manpZmpl7y6ecClo6ivkaOwpnnCrqmfnadk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./geoffrey-giuliano.html><span>←</span><span>Geoffrey Giuliano Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
