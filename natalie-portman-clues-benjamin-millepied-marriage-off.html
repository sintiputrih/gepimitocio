The Oscar winner’s husband “would sometimes not return home and was taking work trips that didn’t add up, and that’s when she “began to suspect infidelity.” Feeling “humiliated and utterly crushed” by her husband’s alleged cheating, Portman decided the best course of action was “taking time to focus on herself.” <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jennifer-garner_16812b.jpg alt="Jennifer Garner" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Jennifer Garner May Have a 'Painful' Reason Why She Put up a Boundary With Ben Affleck</span></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jennifer-garner_16812b.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Millepied allegedly had an affair with climate activist Camille Étienne, 25, according to Voici, and after promising Portman that their entanglement had ended, photographers captured the affair partners together. However, the May December star was determined to work things out not only for herself, but also for their two children, Aleph, 12, and Amalia, 6. “He is doing all he can <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/2783152/natalie-portman-benjamin-millepied-alleged-affair/>to get Natalie to forgive him </a>and keep their family together,” an insider told People last summer. “Natalie is incredibly private and has no intention of playing this out in the media. Her biggest priority is protecting her children and their privacy.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Unfortunately, the Us Weekly insider noted that Portman gave her ex far too many chances and “looked the other way for a long time.” Millepied also has <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/2822121/natalie-portman-benjamin-millepied-marital-status-update/>a history of stepping out of his relationships</a> when he reportedly left then-girlfriend, American Ballet Theater ballerina Isabella Boylston, for Portman during the filming of Black Swan. Portman’s pals stood by the mantra that “you lose him how you get him.” That’s a hard lesson to learn, especially when there are two kids now involved in the equation. Yet it appears that Portman now thinks Millepied was “cheating on her for many years.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The source confirmed that the pair officially split in August, and it looks like there is no going back at this point. Portman shared with <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.wsj.com/style/natalie-portman-may-december-skin-care-books-garden-state-7678b097 rel=nofollow>The Wall Street Journal</a> that she “lives in Paris with her two children” which made it sound like Millepied is out of the picture for good. A second Us Weekly insider divulged that the actress “gave this marriage her best shot,” but she’s also “a realist who isn’t going to stick around trying to save something that’s unfixable.”</p><p><strong>Before you go, click <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a> to see all the celebrity couples who have stayed together after cheating scandals.</strong> <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jennifer-garner_16812b.jpg alt="Jennifer Garner" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Jennifer Garner May Have a 'Painful' Reason Why She Put up a Boundary With Ben Affleck</span></a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/celebrity-couples-cheating-scandals.jpg alt="Kate Middleton, Prince William" width=693 height=390 sizes="(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpoamlohXSCmGilmqyRobamec%2Boqa2lkaN6pLjUnqpmmpWjt6K5yKdkpqGcobKxtcSdZKaZoqe2orPEZqafnl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./myles-jack-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Myles Jack Net Worth | Bio, Family, Address, Career</span></a>
