The dancer, who is currently participating in Fox’s Celebrity Watch Party and backyard Worldwide Live concerts on YouTube, opened up exclusively to Us Weekly about <a href=#>her bond with her former coach</a>, 54.</p><p>“I actually talk to Abby the most out of anybody from the show. She’s great. I think Abby got hurt by a lot of people and it’s really, really, really sad that a lot of the people don’t talk to her anymore,” the Masked Singer alum, 16, said. “The same thing with a lot of the producers from Dance Moms. It’s just sad because Abby really is a good person. Even though you see her yelling and screaming at children on TV, like Abby made seven stars. I wouldn’t be doing this if it wasn’t for her. <a href=#><strong>Maddie</strong></a> and <strong>Mackenzie [Ziegler]</strong> wouldn’t be where they are today without Abby.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/JoJo-Siwa-Thinks-Its-Sad-People-Dont-Talk-to-Dance-Moms-Abby-Lee-Miller-Anymore.jpg><p>In 2013, Siwa was a top 5 finalist on season 2 of Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition. She was eliminated during week 9. She reunited with Miller in 2015, joining the <a href=#>cast of Dance Moms for seasons 5 and 6</a>.</p><p>In 2017, Miller was sentenced to one year and one day in prison for bankruptcy fraud; she was <a href=#>released after eight months</a>, in March 2018. Shortly after, she underwent back surgery and Us confirmed that she had been <a href=#>diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma</a>. In February 2020, the former coach <a href=#>teared up during an appearance on the Dr. Oz Show</a> about still needing a wheelchair and being unable to teach dance.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Dance Moms would not have been the same without Abby. You either love her or you hate her. That’s just how it works,” Siwa shared with Us. “But for me, I just can’t hate somebody. It’s sad. You don’t need to give her the credit for everything, but you also can be a human and have a little bit of sympathy. She’s gone through it in these last years, and she doesn’t have that many people. It’s just sad. … I try to be there for everybody, you know? There’s enough love!”</p><p>With reporting by Brody Brown</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGoop9iwKrDwGagrGWimq6tuNhmqpqcXaWysLzLnmSdp56perWty6Rkraddlq%2BjxYylnJ5lnZ65rbHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-swimmers-real-life-sisters-detail-harrowing-true-story-html.html><span>←</span><span>'The Swimmers' Real-Life Sisters Detail Harrowing True Story</span></a>
