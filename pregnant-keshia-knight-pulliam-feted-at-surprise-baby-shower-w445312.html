Pregnant <b>Keshia Knight Pulliam</b> and her baby-to-be, Ella, were celebrated with a baby shower on Sunday, October 16.</p><p>The <i>Cosby Show</i> alum, 37, was feted by her family, friends and role models, who are a part of her Kamp Kizzy non-profit foundation, with a pink-themed party.&nbsp;</p><p>“My Kamp Kizzy babies completely surprised me with a beautiful shower to celebrate Ella Grace today!!” the actress shared along with a bevy of group photos on Instagram on Sunday. “I am so grateful & appreciative of all of their hard work. My heart is full. Ella has so much love… she is going to grow up wondering why everyone doesn't have 72 aunties & uncles, 60 cousins & more sisters than she can count!! Lol!! I love you all so very much… Ella & I are the world's luckiest girls to have all of you. You are my first babies & I am so proud that Ella will have so many amazing role models to look up to.#I❤️YouToTheMoonAndBack #KampKizzy#Grateful #YouGuysAlwaysMakeMeCry.”</p><p>null</p><p>The actress’ brothers — James Pulliam II and Mshon Pulliam — as well as her dad, James Sr., were also in attendance.</p><p>“Last one…,” Pulliam, who is due in January, captioned an Instagram photo with the men in her family, along with the hashtags: “#FamilyOverEverthing#EllaGracesBodyguards#GrandpaDeuceHasHisGunsOut 😂😂😂.”</p><p>The happy day comes amid Pulliam’s nasty divorce from estranged husband <b>Ed Hartwell</b>. As previously reported by<i> Us</i>, the Kandidly Keshia podcast host alleged during an interview with Entertainment Tonight in July that Hartwell had been unfaithful during their marriage after he blindsided her by filing for divorce just seven months after they said “I do.”</p><p>Hartwell denied that he cheated and also stated in an interview with<i> Page Six</i> that he didn’t want to have a baby with the actress.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think we probably messed up. I think we moved too fast,” he told <i>Page Six</i> after learning the former child star was pregnant. “Our lives and wants are headed two different directions.”</p><p>Pulliam, who played little Rudy Huxtable on <i>The Cosby Show</i>, has seemingly gained strength from their split, however, and revealed via her podcast that her daughter’s middle name, Grace, stems from the heartache the actress has endured.</p><p>“In the midst of all of this was when she earned her middle name, Grace,” the actress shared in August. “When I tell you through all of this the grace of God has so been with us and has covered us and protected us, and she’s been my saving grace to get through it — just knowing that it’s not about me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602ainquYnq5ut82inqGsXaXCrbjImqRmnpWpsqV5wK1krK2ipb%2Bqv8RmmZqaqWLAqbvWnqlmr2RpgnR9kWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patty-mayo.html><span>←</span><span>Patty Mayo</span></a>
