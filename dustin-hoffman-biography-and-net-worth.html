(Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)</p><p>Dustin Lee Hoffman was born on August 8th 1937 in Los Angeles, California. Hoffman was raised in a Jewish family alongside an older brother, although he later described his upbringing as fairly non-religious. After graduating from high school in 1955, Hoffman enrolled at Santa Monica College. Dustin initially wanted to pursue a career in medicine, but he soon realized that life was not for him. In addition, Hoffman once considered a <a href=#>career</a> as a classical pianist.</p><p>He dropped out of college after one year, joining the Pasadena Playhouse and pursuing a career as a professional actor. His family was sceptical about his career goals, claiming that he couldn’t succeed in Hollywood due to his average looks. Unphased, Hoffman continued to sharpen his acting abilities and took classes at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Hoffman’s early acting career was not easy, and he found himself working odd jobs in order to support himself. His first notable roles were in theatre productions at the Pasadena Playhouse. He worked with a young&nbsp;Gene Hackman, and Dustin later followed Hackman to New York City, living with him alongside&nbsp;Robert Duvall&nbsp;during the 60s. Hoffman found it quite difficult to get work due to his appearance, but early roles during this period included off-Broadway and Broadway productions. He also appeared in TV series like “Naked City,” “The Defenders,” and “Hallmark of Fame.”</p><p>Dustin’s <a href=#>film</a> debut came in 1967 with “The Tiger Makes Out.” His breakthrough came later that year with the release of “The Graduate,” in which he played the lead. Hoffman received an Academy Award nomination for this role, for which he received a salary of $20,000 (which became a net of $4,000 after taxes and expenses). Despite receiving multiple offers to star in new films, Hoffman returned to New York to further his stage career. He later followed up with a film role in “Midnight Cowboy.”</p><p>During the 1970s, Hoffman appeared in films like “Straw Dogs,” “Lenny,” “All the President’s Men,” “Marathon Man,” “Straight Time,” and “Agatha.” To end the decade, Hoffman took a lead role in “Kramer vs. Kramer,” winning his first Academy Award. During the eighties, he appeared in “Tootsie” before appearing in the critical and commercial failure that was “Ishtar.” Hoffman once again ended the decade with an Academy Award win, this time for his role in “Rain Man.”</p><p>Dustin’s success continued throughout the 90s with roles in films like “Hook,” “Outbreak,” “Sleepers,” and “Wag the Dog.” This run of notable roles continued throughout the 2000s with “Moonlight Mile,” “Runaway Jury,” “Finding Neverland,” “I Heart Huckabees,” “Meet the Fockers,” and “Mr. Magorium’s Wonder Emporium.” He also booked a prominent voice acting role in the commercially successful animated film “Kung Fu Panda.”</p><p>During the 2010s, Hoffman booked a role in the HBO series “Luck” before directing his first film, “Quartet.” In 2017, he starred in the critically-acclaimed movie “The Meyerowitz Stories.”</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Dustin Hoffman has a net worth of $100 Million USD.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Dustin Hoffman’s first wife was Anne Bryne, an actress whom he met in 1963. After their marriage in 1969, Hoffman adopted Bryne’s child from a previous marriage. They then divorced in 1980. That year, he married businesswoman Lisa Gottsegen, and they subsequently had four children together. The family raised their children Jewish.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How old is Dustin Hoffman?</h3><p>Dustin Hoffman was born on August 8, 1937 (86 years old)</p><h3>Who is Dustin Hoffman?</h3><p>Dustin Hoffman is an&nbsp; American actor, Film Producer and director.</p><h3>How much is Dustin Hoffman worth?</h3><p>Dustin Hoffman has a net worth of $100 Million.</p><h2>More Articles on RNN</h2><ul><li><a href=#>Rachel Miner’s Biography And Net Worth</a></li><li><a href=#>Robert Irwin’s Biography And Net Worth</a></li><li><a href=#>Stephan Paternot Biography and Net Worth</a></li><li><a href=#>Casey Wilson’s Biography And Net Worth</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqnqN7r7OOnaysrJmjeqm7xZ%2BkmqZdl7aws9Gap6GxXZa7pXnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./do-you-shampoo-after-applying-semi-permanent-color.html><span>←</span><span>Do you shampoo after applying semi-permanent color?</span></a>
