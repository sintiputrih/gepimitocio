He went on:</p><p>I didn’t know whether to take that person at their word or not. I can tell you this: When I wrote the [1993] pilot, I called the FBI to do some research, and they were nice enough, but didn’t really give me the time of day. Then, all of a sudden, as we got close to airing, the FBI called and said, “Who are you and what are you doing?” And for a second, I thought it was going to be the long arm of the law coming in to shut me down.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4ee744cfc4fb1fc30310c90f11e45e6d-4-0-0@published data-word-count=41>Carter says they patched things up and he became buddies with the bureau, hanging out, shooting the breeze (literally&nbsp;— they took him to a shooting range).
