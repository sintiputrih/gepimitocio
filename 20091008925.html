Halle's parents divorced when she was four, and her mum, a psychiatric nurse from Liverpool, raised her alone.</p><p id=eruAFAXlzSU data-wc=29>As a mixed-race teenager growing up in a predominantly white secondary school, Halle says she was painfully insecure. "It was sickening how much I craved being liked," she recalls.</p><p id=erLWhKGKrRC data-wc=17>"I was Miss Everything – cheerleader, student senator, on the newspaper, the honour roll, you name it."</p><p id=e0SGAucFb-B data-wc=16>By the time she was 18, she held real-life "Miss" titles, as a national beauty queen.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><h2>Halle Berry's start in acting</h2><p id=e1FrRs-fBKj data-wc=18>Halle began her showbiz career playing a model in the short-lived American TV programme Living Dolls in 1991.</p><p id=efdElW6SNOz data-wc=45>The former beauty queen got her big break, however, in Spike Lee's Jungle Fever, persuading the director to cast her as a decidedly unglamorous crack addict. It turned out to be a wise career move. "With that movie, people realised I could act," she says.</p><p id=eDOZm6QLUiYz data-wc=22>Next she co-starred with Eddie Murphy in Boomerang, and went on to roles in more than a dozen films during the 1990s.</p><p id=eWQlyrrh33J1 data-wc=30>She also took on a number of TV endeavours, including the biopic Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, which she executive produced and for which she won a Golden Globe and an Emmy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/64e34e2b1515-halle-berry-beachside-photo-1.jpg><h2>Halle Berry's present career</h2><p id=ezKPNTmUFZnY data-wc=35>Halle has forged ahead in her career in the meantime, playing the famed X-Men superhero Storm in the film versions of the comic-book series and taking a lead role in 007 instalment Die Another Day.</p><p id=e35_kMTpVfQe data-wc=38>But the crowning glory of her career to date must surely be the Oscar she garnered for her gritty role alongside <a class=hm-link href=#>Billy Bob Thornton</a> in Monster's Ball&nbsp;– a performance that also earned her a Golden Globe nomination.</p><p id=egCpkyJtVfkq data-wc=14>Halle has also starred as Catwoman and in the movie Kingsman: The Golden Ci<strong>rcle.</strong></p><h2>Halle Berry on racial discrimination in movies</h2><p id=eRI9VzDV_4N9 data-wc=13>Halle says she's missed a lot of opportunities as a result of discrimination.</p><p id=eJggNPde7HFG data-wc=34>"I never even got the chance to read for The Silence Of The Lambs or Indecent Proposal," she says. "The excuse is that a black woman would change what the movie was all about."</p><p id=eVj_F4czdmgQ data-wc=52>And for Halle, every part counts – she even considers her 1994 role as a prehistoric temptress in The Flintstones a coup. "They wanted a <a class=hm-link href=#>Sharon Stone</a> type," she explains. "I really pushed for the part. It was important to me that a black woman be seen as the object of desire."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/514ad191d1a1-halle-berry-oscars-z.jpg><h2>Halle Berry's private life</h2><p id=eAqmagyscpfd data-wc=53>Just as her career hasn't always been rosy, Halle has also had hard times in her private life, and she admits she's been in "a few bad relationships" – some of them abusive. One unidentified boyfriend was so violent that he dealt Halle a blow to her ear that left her partially deaf.</p><p id=ervscLsYsNUC data-wc=35>The actress thought she'd found lasting love with baseball star David Justice, whom she married in 1994. But three years later a bitter divorce ensued – a struggle she says nearly drove her to suicide.</p><p id=eAN7K5BYHVva data-wc=37>"I think that's the weakest I've been in my entire life," she confides. "That's what the break-up of my marriage reduced me to. It took away my self-esteem. It beat me down to the lowest of lows."</p><p id=er-vsyuNSlPJ data-wc=39>Halle bounced back, however, and developed a new strategy to find true love. "I just have to choose wisely – someone who can handle my neediness, someone who is willing and able to keep filling up my love cup."</p><h2>Halle Berry's children</h2><p id=epTbVZU2X5mr data-wc=42>After a five-year marriage to R&B singer Eric Benet – which ended in divorce in 2004 – Halle met Canadian model Gabriel Aubry.&nbsp;The two fell in love and welcomed a daughter, Nahla, in 2008, but Halle vowed she wouldn't wed again.</p><p id=eYlMXwqFaOTl data-wc=49>"Gabriel and I don't look at our relationship in terms of forever, we look at it as right here today," she said in 2009. "It's wonderful, but neither one of us feels the need to attach ourselves to each other for life – because it may not be that."</p><p id=e5NxgjCP1C6M data-wc=15>However, in 2010, Gabriel issued a statement confirming the pair had gone their separate ways.</p><p id=eUR8i6z2JBSu data-wc=62>"She is, and will forever be, one of the most special and beautiful people I have ever known, and I am certain we will continue to have only love and respect for one another,” he said. “We have been blessed with the most amazing daughter in the world, and her happiness and wellbeing is the most important thing for both of us.”</p><p id=eLMqthMGaQ28 data-wc=60>It wasn't long before Halle found love again in the arms of French film star Olivier Martinez, who she met while filming Dark Tide together in South Africa. They married in France in 2013 and welcomed their son the same year. Two years later though, the couple announced they were parting ways, but the divorce was only finalised in 2023.</p><p id=eXqJJTEshPZH data-wc=9>Halle has since dated Grammy-winning American musician Van Hunt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9yamVktaK4y55km52ip8Zw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emily-ratajkowski-paris-fashion-week-courreges-abs-look-8601810.html><span>←</span><span>Emily Ratajkowski Flaunted Her Abs in Black Leather At PFW</span></a>
