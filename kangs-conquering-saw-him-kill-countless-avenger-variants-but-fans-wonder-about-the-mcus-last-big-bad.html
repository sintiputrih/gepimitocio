Recommended Videos In the movie, Kang is presented as a multiversal time-traveling ruler who destroys entire timelines with as much speed and efficiency as, say, Thonos’ snap. After capturing Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and his daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), Kang informs the tiny Avenger that this isn’t even the first he’s come face to face with a member of Earth’s mightiest heroes."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

That Kang’s comment — “You’re an Avenger? Have I killed you before?” — is offered without fanfare speaks volumes to the level of this villain’s power.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Has Kang killed or seen a Thanos variant</a> from <a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true>Marvel fans on Reddit are now returning to Kang’s comment and pondering whether it implies he’s also encountered Thanos in his multiversal travels. More importantly, they’re wondering whether he has killed Thanos before.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>As one fan puts it, pitting Kang against Thanos is like asking whether Batman or Superman would win in a fight. As we know, physical combat skills and the right technology can do wonders. If he had time to prepare, Kang could win. If not, well, snap you go.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>darth_wasabi’s comment from discussion "Has Kang killed or seen a Thanos variant"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>Another fan says “it’s pretty much guaranteed” that Kang has killed Thanos at some point in time, and even claims Thanos is a “whole class below Kang,” which we have to admit does match up to what <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the director of Quantumania said</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>TheAmericanCyberpunk’s comment from discussion "Has Kang killed or seen a Thanos variant"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>If we want to get really specific, this Marvel fan says all we have to do is return to episode five of Loki season one, in which a Thanos-Copter Easter egg appears in the background of The Void. The Thanos-Copter was famously used by Thanos in the Marvel comic and subtly (but not completely) implies that the titan fell victim to Kang at some point.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Sandee1997’s comment from discussion "Has Kang killed or seen a Thanos variant"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=136 data-injectable=false>The real issue here, and the reason why so many people are asking this question, is Kang’s (presumed) death at the end of Quantumania.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>t-bonestallone’s comment from discussion "Has Kang killed or seen a Thanos variant"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>Kang’s demise at the end of the movie inarguably tarnishes the madman’s reputation. Should Marvel wish to elevate Kang’s abilities in the eyes of the MCU fans, the cleverest tactic might be to outright confirm that he has indeed killed Thanos in another timeline.</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=false>Someone who’s killed the last big bad of the MCU is no one to be trifled with, to be sure.
