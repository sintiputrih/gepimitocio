The Attache case is composed of a grid system that can be manipulated to fit your preferences, with items snapping into place and able to be rotated as needed. Don’t let the initial small size of the case discourage you, as you can purchase bigger cases from the Merchant as you progress through the game. The game offers five Attache cases, each with its own unique look and bonuses. One of the most eye-catching ones is the Gold one. This guide explains how to get gold attache cases in Resident Evil 4 remake.</p><p data-injection=true><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">What is the best handgun in Resident Evil 4 remake?</a></p><h2>Where to find the gold attache case in Resident Evil 4 remake</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Gold-Attache-case-perks.jpg><p data-injection=true>The Gold Attache case in Resident Evil 4 Remake is unavailable to standard edition buyers.

This is a letdown for those who missed out on the opportunity. However, it is worth noting that Capcom has a track record of releasing similar bonuses as downloadable content for their Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes. Therefore, there may be hope for the Gold Attache case to become available as DLC.</p><p>Gold Attache case benefits are undeniable for those lucky enough to own it; it increases the drop rate of pesetas, the game’s main currency. This allows players to accumulate more funds to purchase ammunition, curative supplies, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">even coveted weapons</a>. With the Gold Attache case, you can amass enough pesetas to buy that dream weapon long before you have amassed enough treasure and gems to sell to the Merchant.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dd39bd735ebf6fbf05d2fe8f91a978f7?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Cande Maldonado</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Though Cande started her journey in the video game industry as a localization specialist six years ago, she soon realized that her true calling was to annoy NPCS, smash virtual pottery, and complete every side quest available in RPGs.
