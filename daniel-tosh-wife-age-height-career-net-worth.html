But <strong>Daniel Tosh</strong> performs this work pretty well. His achievements as an actor, along with other endeavours, is pretty outstanding. Daniel Tosh’s wife is also someone who has been there almost every moment.</p><p>Daniel rose to fame from his work in Comedy Central. There is more to him, be it personal or professional life, and be with us till the very end to know more in detail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/tosh-182.jpg><p>But first, some quick facts tend to help the cause</p><h2>Daniel Tosh: Quick Facts</h2><table class=table><tbody><tr><th>Full Name</th><td>Daniel Dwight Tosh</td></tr><tr><th>Date of Birth</th><td>1975/05 /29</td></tr><tr><th>Nickname</th><td>Daniel Tosh</td></tr><tr><th>Marital Status</th><td>Married</td></tr><tr><th>Birthplace</th><td>West Germany</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity</th><td>White</td></tr><tr><th>Age</th><td>44</td></tr><tr><th>Profession</th><td>Comedian</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Height</th><td>6’3″</td></tr><tr><th>Eye colour</th><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><th>Hair colour</th><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth</th><td>$16 million</td></tr><tr><th>Spouse</th><td>Carly Hallam</td></tr><tr><th>Online Presence</th><td><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Wife</h2><p>Every perfect guy needs a better woman to walk the ride of life. Daniel has done a great job of finding the ideal match for her. <strong>Carly Hallam</strong> is the lucky lady who held the hand of Tosh.</p><p>Both of them are enjoying their perfect life. There is no idea about how they met, but sources claim that they married on 15th April 2016. This marriage ceremony took place in Malibu, with only the family and friends being invited.</p><p>Till this point in time, though, there is no information about any kids. But what is sure is the fact that they are living a beautiful life with better chemistry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/tosh-183.jpg><p>Surprisingly this is not his only relationship story, but the comedian dated <strong>Megan Abrigo</strong> in 2009. It was a pretty well-known love saga as they were together most of the time. Sadly their bond broke in 2014.</p><h2>Wiki-Bio</h2><p><strong>Daniel Dwight Tosh</strong> was born on 29th May 1975 in West Germany. The name of his parents is not known to the general media. But sources claim his father was a preacher. Other than this, the talented individual has four siblings. Daniel has a pretty decent relationship with his family and siblings.</p><p>Tosh was born in the states holding the American nationality along with white ethnicity. His zodiac sign falls under Gemini.</p><h2>Age and Body Measurements</h2><p>Daniel was born in 1975, which makes him 44 years old. He stands at the height of 6ft 3inches and weighs 86 kgs. His comic timing and also the delivery propagation tends to attract lots of people to the show. Woefully. There is no information available about his vital body statistics.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Liliana Bird Bio- Daughter, Age, Height, Career, Net Worth, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Daniel has a tall height, and with it comes the cheeky smile that suits his fair complexion skin. To round up his physical outlook, dark brown eyes and hair of the same colour play the lead role.</p><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>Daniel was born in West Germany but moved to Florida immediately. This shift saw him with better opportunities. His childhood was spent alongside his family and siblings. This helped him to fight his anxiety and compulsive disorder issue. The freedom in the family also allowed him to do comedy as a full-time thing.</p><p>For his educational background, though, this talented individual attended Astronaut High School and graduated in1993. After his successful graduation, Tosh went to the University of Central Florida only to graduate in 1996.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Like most of the big-time celebrities, this talented man also did odd jobs as a salesman to make money fulfilling needs. But immediately after graduation, his activities as a stand-up comedian started in local clubs.</p><p>One of the Just For Laughs show televised his work. But the big break came in 2001 with Late Show with David Letterman. This made the artist a household name. After this appearance through association with The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Premium Blend, etc., helped his reach.</p><p>Moreover, some struggle for decent work, this talented individual got his show Daniel Tosh: Completely Serious.&nbsp;After this, though, the work came regularly to him with Sins of the City, Punk’d, Live at Gotham, Brickleberry, and many more.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stand Up Comedian Joe Rogan Bio, Age, Net Worth, Wife, UFC, Career >></a></h4><p>Amidst all of this, what remains the best of all is undoubtedly his own show Tosh: 0. This show started in 2009 and is still on the run. He tends to mock people and find this act of his personal pretty funny.</p><p>Although his program contains racist, sexist jokes, his heart goes out for people. His participation in a show for the family of dead Greg Giraldo is something special. Other than this, organizing shows like Tosh Saves The World has benefited the charity.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Comedy is hard, but it is equally fruitful. If an individual can find the feet in the case of a comedy, then well, there is no looking back. Similar is the case of Daniel Tosh. At this point, his net worth stands at <strong>$16 million</strong>.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brennen Taylor Age, Height, Brother, YouTuber, Net Worth, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Surprisingly this comedian is ranked by Forbes as one of the highest-earning comedians. His earning is from the stage ticket and shows. But there is hardly any information about annual income and assets owned. Whatever might be the case, this talented house lives in Redondo Beach with his wife and family.</p><h2>Social Media Reach</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>– 58.1k followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Twitter</a>– 25.9m followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57w5qlop2cYsGwv8dmrqKelWKuqLGMoZyin5ipeqSt0Z6cq2WemsFuw86rq6Fn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chanel-west-coast-net-worth-boyfriend-gender-pregnant-dating-wiki-bio.html><span>←</span><span>Chanel West Coast Net Worth, Boyfriend, Gender, Pregnant, Dating, Wiki, Bio</span></a>
