The two get engaged to be married, however, it doesn't quite go as planned because (historical spoiler alert!) it was then revealed that Sven was gay and using the marriage as a cover up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9265c1cb9ae4-sven-durrells-1-z.jpg><p id=eS0aP5G6nMkj style=text-align:center data-wc=8><strong>His character is the love-interest of Louisa Durrell</strong></p><p id=e0VVJQ9w04pm data-wc=52>At the time, the actor spoke out about the sudden change in events for his character. He told What's on TV: <strong>"It's one-dimensional if he's only supposed to be the good-looking, charming guy. We've seen that a billion times before.</strong> This made for a much more interesting character, with complexity and depth."</p><p id=eRjhGx-Zi1cs data-wc=68>He added:<strong>&nbsp;"Sven broke his own heart as well as hers. I hope people understand why he did what he did. He didn't act out of selfishness.</strong> I hope people will understand and accept it; it’s a timeless issue. Although it’s still difficult, it was a lot harder in 1935. Thankfully there's a lot of acceptance today, but back in the day it was a whole different story."</p><h2>What else has Ulric von der Esch been in?</h2><p id=ev4pghDB-EJs data-wc=44><strong>Ulric's role in is his first major TV role on British TV</strong>, but he appeared in European series and prior to the ITV show.
