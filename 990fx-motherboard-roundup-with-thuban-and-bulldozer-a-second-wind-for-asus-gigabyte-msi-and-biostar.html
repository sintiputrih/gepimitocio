With the 900-series, users now have access to a graphical UEFI BIOS, similar to recent Intel chipsets, and also have full support of 2.2+ TB devices.</p><p>With all that in mind, for this article we are testing and reviewing the following products and prices:</p><p><a href=#>$215</a>&nbsp;- ASUS Crosshair V Formula<br><a href=#>$185</a> - ASUS Sabertooth 990FX<br><a href=#>$180</a> - Gigabyte 990FXA-UD5<br><a href=#>$195</a> - MSI 990FXA-GD80<br><a href=#>$130</a> - Biostar TA990FXE</p><p>These boards will be tested with both a previous generation Thuban processor (the X6 1100T) and a high end Bulldozer processor (FX-8150), under AMD’s all-in-one liquid cooling solution (which is made by Asetek, and is essentially their take on the Corsair H80).&nbsp; With a wide range of price points and feature sets, let us see what they can do, starting with the ASUS Republic of Gamers Crosshair V Formula.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIJ4fZNocHJolq16rrvToZyrmp%2BWv6V50aisp5ylpXq4tdOhZK2gpZeur3nAp5tmmqWhuaW72Z6pZpldqLKku82dZLChnpl6p7vRZpisraNitKqzwJuwrZ1dosCqecCnm2aamaTAta3R</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./suicide-squad-ayer-cut-image-reveals-harley-quinn-in-a-wedding-dress.html><span>←</span><span>Suicide Squad Ayer Cut image reveals Harley Quinn in a wedding dress</span></a>
