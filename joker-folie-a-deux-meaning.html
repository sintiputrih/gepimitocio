As of now, hundreds of fans are fully convinced that the "madness of two" translation suggests the one and only <a href=#>Harley Quinn</a> will appear alongside the Joker.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Folie à deux translates to "shared madness," so ... there's gonna be Harley Quinn in it ... that raises the question: Who will play her?" one fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> on Twitter.</p><p>Another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a>, "They've gotta be doing a version of Harley Quinn; the subtitle Folie á Deux translates to "madness for two," and look at the colors: black and red."

So it would be possible to have not duelling Jokers but someone that [claims] to be the Joker that isn't the Joker," the 66-year-old actor told the outlet.</p><p>"And that kind of opens up the possibility of an interesting story, particularly if you had Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker, and then you had someone who was either imitating or riffing off what he did," he continued. "I fantasized about that. But other than that I am not talking to anybody [about it], you're the first one."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">We've got you covered on the "Folie à Deux" pronuncation!</h2><p>Of course, following the title announcement, fans flocked to Google Translate and YouTube to figure out how the heck to pronounce "Folie à deux."
