The original show follows couples who have received a K-1 visa, which is uniquely available to betrothed partners of US citizens.&nbsp;The Other Way&nbsp;is exactly what it sounds like—American couples who move to their partner’s home country.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Natalie-josh-still-together-90-day-fiance-.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg><p>“It’s about love,”&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé&nbsp;executive producer,&nbsp;Matt Sharp, told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gold Derby</a>&nbsp;in May 2022 when asked what makes the&nbsp;TLC&nbsp;reality TV&nbsp;series so popular. “Love is primal, but I think we tapped into a couple of things. One is that this show is incredibly authentic. I’m a huge lover of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bachelor</a>&nbsp;and that franchise, however, we were one of the first shows to actually tell real stories about ordinary Americans and their love journeys. Also, this show is about this journey with other cultures. When we launched this show in 2014, we were on the ‘love frontier’ of this whole new era of finding people all over the world.”</p><p>He continued: “This is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the most diverse show on television</a>,” Sharp asserted. “You can challenge me on it. We featured people from 51 countries at this point. We have subtitles. We have people that don’t speak the same language and have completely different cultures. We’re trying to tell unique stories every time and when we’re in the casting process we’re evaluating people based on their personalities, backgrounds and their stories, but also we just want to tell unique, fresh, interesting stories.” With all that said, here’s if Veronica and Jamal are still together from 90 Day Fiancé: The Single Life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=are-veronica-and-jamal-still-together-from-90-day-fiance-the-single-life>Are Veronica and Jamal still together from 90 Day Fiancé: The Single Life?</h2><p>Are Veronica and Jamal still together from 90 Day Fiancé: The Single Life? They do follow each other on social media, which as we’re all aware is a decent indicator. The last photo they took together was posted on January 8, 2024, and while they don’t post about each other a lot, that’s likely due to the fact that they live in different states; he’s in California, she’s in North Carolina.</p><p>On his Instagram account, he makes it very clear that he’s still in San Diego (through the drop pin emoji) and has not moved to Charlotte as Veronica would like. One big reason Jamal doesn’t want to move is because Veronica’s ex, Tim, is “always in [his] ear”.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p><a href=#>Their long-distance relationship</a> has proven to be a sore point for the couple. When they revealed to everyone in early January that they were “exclusive” (after previously saying they were in an open relationship, more on that later), Veronica said Jamal was “not a great communicator,” which made Veronica question their future. “You suck at communication,” she told him in a clip for the show. “You don’t text back at all.”</p><p>Jamal said he felt like they didn’t need to “talk 24/7”, explaining that, “I’m more of a face-to-face person, that’s always been my vibe,” he said. “Like, when we’re here, we’re here. But Veronica takes it personally when I’m not available to her and I can see maybe an insecurity of her thinking like, ‘Oh, he just doesn’t care to talk to me,’ but that’s never been the case.”</p><p>Veronica told the cameras, “<a href=#>I want to settle down</a>, like, forever-ever with someone and I just want things to keep going well for Jamal and I’s relationship,” she said. “I think it’s worth the risk but if he hurts me, it, you know, could crush me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veronica-90-DayThe-Single-Life-.jpg><p>In December 2022, Veronica—who fans would know from Single Life season 3 before her return to season 4—revealed that she was dating a fellow cast member’s son. Kim, who’s appeared on 90 Day Fiancé Before the 90 Days, 90 Day Fiancé Pillow Talk, 90 Day Fiancé Happily Ever After, and 90 Day Diaries, is Jamal’s mom.</p><p>At the time, Veronica and Jamal stressed that they weren’t in an exclusive relationship and Jamal admitted that he was sleeping with other people, but Veronica said she was too “lazy” to pursue anyone else.</p><p>Veronica’s relationship with a man named Justin didn’t work out and her close relationship with her ex, Tim, has raised <a href=# rel=nofollow>eyebrows in the past</a>. “I’ve never seen Veronica date someone younger, she constantly gives me s—t for the age difference between me and my girlfriend. It’s not just that though, like, it sounds super negative but, like, again, it seems like a waste of time,” Tim said.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
