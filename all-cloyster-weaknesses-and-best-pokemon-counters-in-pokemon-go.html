Raid Pokémon are some of the strongest combatants you can face, and they’re extremely tough, even for a single player. If you’re looking to take down Cloyster, you might be able to do it by yourself, but having a friend backup you is extremely helpful. In this guide, we will cover all of Cloyster weaknesses and the best Pokémon counters in Pokémon Go.</p><h2>All Cloyster weaknesses</h2><p data-injection=true>Cloyster is a Water and Ice-type Pokémon. It is weak against Electric, Fighting, Grass, and Rock-types, but it is resistant against Ice and Water-type Pokémon. Therefore, you want to avoid those two types as much as possible, primarily leaning on Electric, Fighting, or Rock-types. Grass-types are helpful, but they are weak to Ice-type attacks.</p><h2>Best Pokémon counters to Cloyster</h2><p>The best Pokémon to counter Cloyster is Lucario, Zarude, and Magnezone.</p><p>Lucario is a Fighting and Steel-type Pokémon. It’s a powerful fighter that is perfect to battle against Cloyster, exploiting its Fighting-type weakness with plenty of attacks and a formidable defense. The best moveset to teach Lucario is the fast move counter and the charged moves aura sphere and close combat.</p><p data-injection=true>Next, we have Zarude, the mythical Grass and Dark-type Pokémon. It’s a Pokémon that was available to all trainers for a limited time, and it came with a decent amount of stats to make it a practical choice for this raid battle. The best moveset for Zarude is the fast move vine whip and the charged move dark pulse and power whip.</p><p>The last choice we highly recommend is Magnezone, the Electric and Steel-type Pokémon. Like Lucario, is has an incredible attack power and a mountain of defense to make it difficult to be defeated. The best moveset to teach Magnezone is fast move spark and the charged moves wild charge and zap cannon.</p><p data-injection=true>You’re going to need a full team of six Pokémon to defeat Cloyster. These are some other recommendations you may want to consider adding to your roster for this raid battle.</p><ul><li>Conkeldurr</li><li>Electivire</li><li>Luxray</li><li>Machamp</li><li>Raikou</li><li>Rhyperior</li><li>Roserade</li><li>Sirfetch’d</li><li>Tangrowth</li><li>Venusaur</li><li>Zapdos</li><li data-injection=true>Zekrom</li></ul><p>After defeating Cloyster, you have the chance to capture this Pokémon. There is a chance you could catch a shiny version of Cloyster at the end of the battle.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
