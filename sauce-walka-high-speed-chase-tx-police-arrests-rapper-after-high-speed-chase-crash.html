The narrative states that the rapper was taken into custody. Additionally, around the same year, he launched the independent record label that would later be known as The Sauce Factory. The man who is a father of one and who has an astonishing 1.6 million followers on Instagram has been involved in a few disagreements with the police throughout the course of his rap career. Other individuals have also been involved in these disputes.</p><p>Around the same time that Walka entered a guilty plea to the charge of hazardous behavior in 2009, he was involved in an incident that involved a firearm. The incident took place as a result of a shooting that took place during a concert that was performed at Texas Southern University. Before crashing his vehicle early on Wednesday morning, he led the Houston police department on a high-speed chase. As a result of the incident, the rapper Sauce Walka was brought into custody.</p><p>After reaching speeds of 130 miles per hour for more than two miles in an attempt to elude the police, the hitmaker of “Big Drip Squad,” who is 33 years old, is facing charges of avoiding arrest or detention, as reported by Fox 26. The charges stem from the fact that he attempted to evade the authorities. Albert Walker Mondale, better known by his stage name Sauce Walka, is expected to appear in court on Friday. His appearance is slated to take place.</p><p>The year 2007 marked the beginning of Walka’s career as a rapper. During this time, he was a member of the Houston rap group Mostheard and used the moniker A-Walk. Walka’s career began in 2007. Subsequently, in the year 2014, he changed his stage name to Sauce Walka, and later that same year, he collaborated with the rapper Sancho Saucy to form a duet that they referred to as Sauce Twinz.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwv8Cump5lp5a5rK2MoaCgoF2ovaaxw2aaoZmjmnq1xIyppqWhk5p6or7Rnqqtq12nrrG8xKtkmp6kmr9utMign2aroJqypXnCoZisnV2Yv6K%2Fx2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kenny-baldwin-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-378942-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kenny Baldwin Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
