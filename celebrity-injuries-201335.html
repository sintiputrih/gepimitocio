Witherspoon was later released from the hospital and went home to recover, while the 84-year-old driver was cited for failing to yield to a pedestrian in a crosswalk.</p><p>Nearly a decade later, <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> alum Mellencamp shared photos from her own injury.</p><p>“I gave 2020 the boot — and 2021 returned the favor!” the former <a href=#>Bravo personality joked in January 2021</a> via social media alongside a photo of her on crutches. Mellencamp twisted her ankle while playing pickleball with her family over the holidays.</p><p>She <a href=#>made light of the situation</a>, telling her followers, “The silver lining: it’s called a ‘dancer’s fracture’ so I’m basically a ballerina now. Pickle Ball: 1. Teddi: 0.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Mariska Hargitay</strong></a>, for her part, suffered two separate injuries in 2021.

Hargitay <a href=#>showed off her progress via Instagram</a> in July 2021, saying she was “healing like a boss” while wearing a funny “It hurt, thank you for asking” T-shirt.</p><p>Scroll down to see what other celebrities have overcome health scares and minor injuries through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJupoqypYravttSroJ6rXWd9cn%2BSbmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./married-at-first-sight-one-couple-may-never-have-sex-w491273.html><span>←</span><span>'Married at First Sight': One Couple May Never Have Sex</span></a>
