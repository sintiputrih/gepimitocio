In late 2021, Joe Gatto announced that he would not be returning to the show.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>His departure came on the tail of an “amicable” divorce from his wife of eight years and as he said, trials in his personal life. Gatto took to Instagram to express gratitude for Sal, Murr, and Q and the long-time fans of the show. he stated that he wanted time to focus on his family and his children while they went through a difficult transition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Joe Gatto (@joe_gatto)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>Since then, Gatto has found other ways to bring humor to the world as a solo act. He began performing stand-up comedy less than a month after his departure from the show, and even has his own charity called Gatto Pups and Friends which is a nonprofit rescue for senior and disabled dogs.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Just two months after he left the show, Gatto also began a comedy podcast called Two Cool Moms with comedian Steve Byrne where they give advice to their listeners.

He shared on Scheana Shay’s podcast Scheananigans that he may be interested in making a live appearance with the remaining jokers, saying that he misses working with his friends. Unfortunately for many fans, a return to TV doesn’t seem to be in the cards any time soon.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>Despite his words, fan remain hopeful, and it doesn’t seem like there is any bad blood between the cast members, so a return is more likely than many once thought.
