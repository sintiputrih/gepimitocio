The <a href=#>celebrity</a> wife was born on 10 October 1964 in Memphis, Tennessee, USA, to <a href=#>Doris</a> and James Bridges. She has a brother, but there is no information available about him.</p><h3>Who was Marjorie Harvey married to before?</h3><p class=align-left>The Tennessee native had been married twice before meeting American comedian Steve Harvey. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The pair met in 1990</a> at a comedy club in Memphis and dated for a few weeks before going their separate ways.</p><p class=align-left>Over 10 years later, in 2005, they reunited after Steve's second marriage ended. The third time was the charm for both, as the <i>Family Feud</i> host married Bridges in 2007.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/a211c51a12c773eb.jpg><p class=align-left>Although she is best known for being the celebrity wife of the comedian, the founder of Lady Loves Couture's past marriages have made tabloid headlines. These are Marjorie Bridges Woods' ex-husbands.</p><h4><strong>Jim Townsend</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Marjorie Harvey's first husband was Jim Townsend, and they were married in the 1990s. They have two children, a daughter, Morgan, and a son, Jason, who <a href=#>Steve</a> legally adopted after they wed.</p><p class=align-left>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>, Townsend was a drug lord who ran a major smuggling ring that moved hundreds of kilos of narcotics between Houston and Memphis. He was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment after getting caught trying to purchase large quantities of cocaine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/f3f79eef6b04357e.jpg><p class=align-left>At his incarceration, his wife was pregnant with their second child, Jason, and their daughter was five. Townsend alleged in an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> that the FBI had substantial evidence against his wife, which led him to make a deal with the feds to prevent her from being indicted.</p><p class=align-left>After 26 years in prison, Jim was pardoned by former president <a href=#>Barack Obama</a> in 2017. In 2023, he released his memoir <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Snakes in the Garden</a>, </i>which he started writing while imprisoned. In his book, he details his marriage, past exploits, and relationship with his children.</p><p class=align-left>The 58-year-old divorced Jim less than five years into his sentence and married her second husband, Donnell Woods.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/21d47bbd5da8b276.jpg><h4><strong>Donnell Woods</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Marjorie Harvey's husband, <a href=#>Donnell Woods</a>, is also a drug kingpin and, allegedly, Jim Townsend's distant cousin. She married him in the early 2000s, but their marriage was short-lived.</p><p class=align-left>Woods was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly</a> arrested, but details of his sentence have not been made public. Unlike Townsend, Donnell has not disclosed details about his marriage to the philanthropist.</p><h3>Who did Marjorie Harvey have kids with?</h3><p class=align-left>The 58-year-old has three biological children from her first two marriages to Jim Townsend and Donnell Woods.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/6c6c6d2eba09e4b0.jpg><h4><strong>Who is Lori Harvey's biological father?</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Donnell Woods <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">fathered the model</a> in 1997, but the two do not have a relationship. Lori is better known as Steve's stepdaughter after he adopted her following his marriage to her mother in 2007.</p><p class=align-left>Marjorie Harvey's previous husbands were ringleaders in drug smuggling rings and have been imprisoned. Donnell Woods remains incarcerated, while Jim Townsend received an 11th-hour pardon in 2017 and has released a tell-all book.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>What does Ronald Recht do for a living?
