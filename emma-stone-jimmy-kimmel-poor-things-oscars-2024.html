I didn’t have that sort of freedom and acceptance in the same way around sexuality,” she said. “But as time has gone on, I think that it’s been very illuminating to me. I mean, one of the conversations that I’ve talked a lot about, having worked with quite a few European people or people that were raised in cultures where nudity and sexuality is not as shame-filled, I guess, it’s been very interesting, you know, and also talking to Yorgos, who’s Greek, our director, it always kind of startles him how much violence is acceptable in sort of American media, but sexuality is, you know, really looked down upon—like, as if watching someone die onscreen is less challenging than watching someone experience pleasure. Yeah, it’s definitely expanded my mind more as I’ve gotten older, too, and sort of broken out of, you know, religion and things like that that I was exposed to at a younger age.”</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
