Make sure to sprinkle with a little salt to season the chicken before dredging.</li><li><strong>Eggs</strong> — whisk the eggs together in a bowl and dip the chicken pieces into the egg mixture. This helps to bind the flour and cornstarch to the chicken.</li><li><strong>Flour and Cornstarch</strong> — using a mixture of both cornstarch and flour makes the perfect coating.</li><li><strong>Oil</strong> — this is what gives the sweet and sour the perfect crisp coating. I suggest using an oil such as canola or vegetable.</li><li><strong>Pineapple Juice</strong> — use 100% pure pineapple juice as it is the base of this sweet and sour sauce.</li><li><strong>Sugar</strong> — granulated sugar brings sweetness and pairs perfectly with vinegar.</li><li><strong>Vinegar</strong> — use apple cider vinegar, rice vinegar, or white vinegar in this recipe. If you want a more tangy sauce, add more vinegar to offset the sweetness.</li><li><strong>Soy Sauce</strong> — brings a salty depth to the sweet and sour sauce.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Red Chili Flakes</strong> — add a touch of spice to the sauce. If you want a spicier sweet and sour sauce, add more red chili flakes.</li><li><strong>Garlic</strong> — use fresh minced garlic or garlic powder in this recipe.</li><li><strong>Ketchup</strong> — adds sweetness and helps to thicken the sauce.</li><li><strong>Cornstarch</strong> — helps to thicken the sauce. Use a whisk to avoid any lumps.</li><li><strong>Fresh Pineapple, Peppers, Red Onion</strong> — if you want to add vegetables, I suggest using assorted colors of peppers, red onion, and fresh pineapple for sweetness.</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sweet-and-Sour-Chicken-3-720x831.jpg alt="Sweet and Sour Chicken is made with crispy fried chicken covered in a pineapple sweet and sour sauce.

Dredge the chicken in whisked eggs and cornstarch/flour mixture until coated.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>To make the homemade sweet and sour sauce</strong>, place pineapple juice, sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, ketchup, and red chili flakes in a pan and cook over medium-high heat. Add cornstarch and cook until thickened.&nbsp;</li><li data-slot-rendered-content=true><strong>Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat</strong>. When frying foods, it is so helpful to use a thermometer. Let the oil heat up to 350 degrees.&nbsp; Once the oil is ready, in batches, cook chicken for about 3-4 minutes until light golden brown.&nbsp; Repeat with remaining chicken.</li><li><strong>Remove from oil and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</strong></li><li><strong>If adding vegetables to the sweet and sour chicken</strong>, saute the vegetables for several minutes before adding to the sauce or you may add them directly to the sauce to simmer.</li><li><strong>Toss fried chicken with the sweet and sour sauce.</strong>&nbsp;Serve immediately.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sweet-and-Sour-Chicken-5-crop-720x946.jpg alt="Sweet and Sour Chicken is made with crispy fried chicken covered in a pineapple sweet and sour sauce.
