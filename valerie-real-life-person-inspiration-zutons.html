 Amy Winehouse. Picture: Getty    By Tom Eames   The woman who inspired The Zutons‘ classic song 'Valerie' has been discovered.
12 years after Amy Winehouse and Mark Ronson‘s cover became an international hit, it has been revealed that the 2006 track was written about Valerie Star, a makeup artist who previously dated Zutons frontman Dave McCabe.
Star and McCabe have spoken about how the song told the story of how she almost went to jail after several driving offences, which led to her cancelling a move to the UK to be with him."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
