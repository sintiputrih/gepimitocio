At the time, Trump said NBC wouldn't have an adult star. Daniels revealed that Trump personally called her, and revealed it wasn't his casting idea.

While there have been several controversial celebrities who’ve performed on Dancing with the Stars, there are two reasons why Baskin’s inclusion was the most ridiculous. First off, The Tiger King portrayed Baskin as a villain so her inclusion was going to turn off some people. More importantly, even though The Tiger King was a sensation after it was released, people moved on from the show surprisingly quickly. As a result, most people didn’t really care about Baskin by the time she appeared on Dancing with the Stars.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"></a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"> 1 day ago<h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="What is the most annoying part of Hell's Kitchen?">What is the most annoying part of Hell's Kitchen?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>As a vehicle to give Gordon Ramsay the chance to yell at foolish chefs, Hell’s Kitchen is practically perfect. However, for viewers who want to invest in the competing chefs and root for the best, Hell’s Kitchen has an annoying problem. Throughout Hell’s Kitchen’s history, there have been far too many examples of more talented chefs seemingly being eliminated so that more “entertaining” chefs can stay.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/carole-baskin-from-dancing-with-the-stars.jpg></a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"> 4 days ago<h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Who is the biggest celebrity reality TV fan?">Who is the biggest celebrity reality TV fan?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>There are a number of A-list celebrities who claim to be addicted to reality TV. This could mean Bravo shows, Netflix dating shows, or even those TLC projects that garner so much controversy. Among the biggest names who are self-professed reality TV fans are Howard Stern, Jessica Chastain, Julia Roberts, Michael Rappaport, Meghan McCain, Jon Hamm, Julia Roberts, Nicki Minaj, Meryl Streep, Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, and Lady Gaga.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"></a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"> Jun 26, 2024<h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Which Top Chef challenge felt completely out of character for the show?">Which Top Chef challenge felt completely out of character for the show?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>During Top Chef: San Francisco, there was a challenge that required the competitors to create dishes for a fetish shop. Two examples of the resulting dishes were named Naughty Nuts and Edible Underwear Drawer. While this challenge and the fact that RuPaul was a guest judge was a lot of fun, there is no denying this felt really out of character for Top Chef. After all, Top Chef is the kind of show that typically runs challenges at events like wine and cheese festivals.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/What-Is-The-Average-Cost-Of-Eating-At-One-Of-Gordon-Ramsays-Resturants.jpg></a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"> Jun 29, 2024<h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="What makes Big Brother feel like a cheap show?">What makes Big Brother feel like a cheap show?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Over the years, the production of Big Brother has been improved in many ways. The most obvious example of that is the fact that the cameras are of much better quality now than when the show began. Despite that, there is one element of Big Brother that makes the show feel cheap far too often. During far too many of Big Brother’s challenges, the decorations that are used look like they will pulled together in a couple of hours. Considering that it is easier than ever for people to find and buy high-quality decorations, there is no excuse for a major network show to look so cheap.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"></a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-icon-colored-dark.svg?v=2.4"> Jun 27, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaqVlrFww8eaq2aho2K3prLFZqerp5KowbR51qiprKxdoryusc2tZJqrXajCs8LIr6arq12dvLTAjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-little-mermaid-upcoming-film-4711623.html><span>←</span><span>The Cast, Release Date, Trailers &amp;amp; More To Know Hollywood Life</span></a>
