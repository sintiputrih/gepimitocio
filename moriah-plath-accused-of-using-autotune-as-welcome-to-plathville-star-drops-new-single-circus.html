I’m a little bit scared, a little bit nervous. Every time I’ve shared a song it’s been a little scary, but especially with this one, because every line in this song has a deep meaning behind it."</p><p>Finally, one December dropped a preview of the music video on her Instagram page with the caption, "Circus is finally out!!!! link in my bio! @plathisaac and I attempted to make a short music video… he did great!

She said that Moriah did approach her and threaten legal action, but she was not taking her songs or income.</p><p>Olivia's credit card was linked to the accounts, so she handled everything on her end. What happens next is unknown, but Moriah now has access to her song and will get the revenues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/d2eb6da2-7aec-4850-98a4-2bb929d04bd2.png><h2 class=split>Moriah Plath released 'Heartbreak' after split from Max Kallschmidt</h2><p>Moriah stated during the season 4 opener that her lover, Max Kallschmidt, had shattered her heart by confessing he had been unfaithful to her.</p><p>While 'Welcome to Plathville' viewers were not given all the specifics, Moriah did release a song called 'Missed Myself' to commemorate her split, which had nasal lyrics and terrible rhymes.</p><p>While some viewers thought she was unique in her expression, others said she was out of sync and should find another job.</p><p>If Moriah's singing wasn't poor enough, Max started making fun of Moriah's second hit, 'Weakness'.</p><p>'Welcome to Plathville' watchers took note when Max uploaded a snapshot of his ex-girlfriend's next song on social media.</p><p>Viewers expected the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Florida</a> native to be encouraging, but instead, he posted a video of himself allegedly criticizing Moriah's abilities.</p><p>Unfortunately for the reality TV actress, the song fell flat with many people, who thought it was cringe-worthy and that Moriah should have hired a better co-writer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/3d9c4bc0-842d-4133-adc1-eb945d5326be.png><h2 class=split>What does 'Welcome to Plathville' star Moriah Plath do for a living?</h2><p>Moriah's jobs include reality TV personality, bartender, singer, and influencer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/3b85df46-8e64-4fa3-9778-e305811358e7.png><p>While her specific earnings are kept hidden, Moriah's entrepreneurial spirit has been critical to her financial success.</p><span class=readpage-disclaimer>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
