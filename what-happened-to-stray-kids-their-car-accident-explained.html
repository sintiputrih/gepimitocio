Recently, the group has been attending to their North American schedule upon performing at the VMAS, preparing for a new comeback just in time for the Global Citizen Festival.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>The event will occur in New York, and aside from Stray Kids, famous headliners include the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Lauryn Hill, BTS member Jung Kook, Anitta, Conan Gray, D-Nice, and Sofia Carson. Initially, Megan Thee Stallion was also scheduled to perform but eventually canceled. Unfortunately, however, StrayKids fans will not be able <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to catch all eight members performing on stage</a>, as some of them are currently on a temporary break. Here’s why.</p><h2 id=h-why-is-stray-kids-taking-a-break data-injectable=false>Why is Stray Kids taking a break?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=711 data-injectable=true>While most members will still be able to fulfill their scheduled concerts, Stray Kids stars Lee Know, Hyunjin, and Seungmin will not partake in the same event, after a minor car collision that occurred. According <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to the announcement made by JYP Entertainment</a> – the group’s label – the three members were inside the car when the accident occurred, and will be taking some time off to rest and recover.</p><p>“While returning to their dorms after a schedule on September 20th (Wednesday), the vehicle carrying Stray Kids members Lee Know, Hyunjin, and Seungmin was involved in a minor collision. After the minor collision, Lee Know, Hyunjin, and Seungmin immediately visited a hospital and received a thorough medical examination. None of the members and accompanying staff in the vehicle were seriously injured, but as they have sustained mild muscle pain and bruises, medical professionals have advised that they receive conservative treatment for the time being.”</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>Thankfully, the company has guaranteed that none of the members sustained any serious injuries. Still, the three members were scheduled to participate in various events while in the United States. Part of their promotional practices included the Milan Fashion Week, which Lee Know and Hyunjin were supposed to attend, and also Seungmin’s YouTube Live which was scheduled for the singer to celebrate with fans during a live stream.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Regarding the Global Citizen Festival, the company also announced a modification in the lineup, and instead of the entire group’s performance, the sub-unit 3Racha will perform. While fans will not have the group together on stage, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they will still be able to see Bang Chan</a>, Changbin, and Han performing on stage, albeit by their sub-unit stage names, CB97, SpearB, and J.One.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkerTA0ZqwZqOZmcBuwMeeoKtlk5a%2Fbq3CnKCdnZ6peqbEz6WYoqaVmXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tamra-cantore.html><span>←</span><span>Tamra Cantore - Bio, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Married, Facts</span></a>
