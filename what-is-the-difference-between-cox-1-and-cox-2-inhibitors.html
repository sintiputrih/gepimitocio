They are used in the treatment of a variety of diseases. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit a particular rate-limiting enzyme called cyclooxygenase (COX) involved in the production of prostaglandins. Two isoforms of this enzyme have been identified: COX 1 and COX 2.&nbsp; COX 1 inhibitor and COX 2 inhibitor are two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs involved in the inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX 1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX 2), respectively.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=contents></span>CONTENTS<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p style=padding-left:30px>1.&nbsp;Overview and Key Difference<br>2.&nbsp;What are&nbsp;COX 1 Inhibitors<br>3.&nbsp;What are&nbsp;COX 2 Inhibitors<br>4.&nbsp;Similarities – COX 1 and COX 2 Inhibitors<br>5. COX 1 vs COX 2 Inhibitors&nbsp;in Tabular Form<br>6.&nbsp;Summary – COX 1 vs COX 2 Inhibitors</p><h2 id="COX 1 Inhibitors"><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-cox-1-inhibitors></span>What are COX 1 Inhibitors?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify>COX 1 inhibitor is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme. This enzyme is constitutively expressed in most tissues. Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX 1) isoform normally produces cytoprotective prostaglandins. This enzyme is present in tissues, including gastrointestinal tract mucosa, kidneys, and platelets. Cyclooxygenase-1 isoform maintains the normal lining of the stomach and intestines. This isoform also protects the stomach from digestive juices. Moreover, Cyclooxygenase-1 isoform is involved in kidney and platelet function. Cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme produces prostaglandins that contribute to pain, fever, and inflammation. Therefore, COX 1 inhibitor is used to inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 isoform. Since the main role of cyclooxygenase-1 is to protect the stomach and intestine and contribute to blood clotting, the use of COX 1 inhibitor drugs can lead to unwanted side effects.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen are inhibitors of both COX 1 and COX 2 isoforms as they are non-selective in their action. Traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used to treat conditions like arthritis. Modern selective COX 1 inhibitors selectively inhibit only COX 1 isoform. Some examples of modern selective COX 1 inhibitors include ketorolac, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, indomethacin, tolmetin, piroxicam, and meclofenamate. However, the inhibition of the COX 1 isoform can lead to side effects such as gastrointestinal ulcers and uncontrolled bleeding.</p><h2 id="COX 2 Inhibitors"><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-cox-2-inhibitors></span>What are COX 2 Inhibitors?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify>COX 2 inhibitor is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme that is expressed in areas of inflammation. Selective COX 2 inhibitor drugs possess a bulky side chain that is too large to orient into the binding site of the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme. But they are enabled to align and bind to the cyclooxygenase-2 isoform. Cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme plays a major role in maintaining vascular integrity.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The inhibition of the cyclooxygenase-2 isoform leads to decreased production of vasodilator prostaglandins from endothelial cells. However, thromboxane from platelets is not inhibited by COX inhibitor due to the lack of COX 2 isoform present on mature platelets. Furthermore, COX inhibitor is thought to be a contributing factor to the increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, pulmonary and systemic hypertension. Some examples include COX 2 inhibitors are sulindac, diclofenac, celecoxib, meloxicam, etodolac, etoricoxib, and lumiracoxib.</p><h2 id="Similarities – COX 1 and COX 2 Inhibitors"><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-similarities-between-cox-1-and-cox-2-inhibitors></span>What are the Similarities Between COX 1 and COX 2 Inhibitors?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>COX 1 inhibitor and COX 2 inhibitor are two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</li><li>They are involved in the inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX 1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX 2) enzymes that produce prostaglandins.</li><li>Both COX 1 and COX 2 inhibitors can cause serious side effects.</li><li>COX 1 and COX 2 inhibitors are selective in action than traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</li></ul><h2 id="COX 1 vs COX 2 Inhibitors&nbsp;in Tabular Form"><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-difference-between-cox-1-and-cox-2-inhibitors></span>What is the Difference Between COX 1 and COX 2 Inhibitors?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify>COX 1 inhibitor is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme, which is constitutively expressed in most tissues, while COX 2 inhibitor is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme, which is expressed in areas of inflammation. Thus, this is the key difference between COX 1 and COX 2 inhibitors. Furthermore, the side effects of the COX 1 inhibitor include gastrointestinal ulcers and uncontrolled bleeding, while the side effects of the COX 2 inhibitor include developing myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, pulmonary and systemic hypertension.</p><p>The below infographic presents the differences between COX 1 and COX 2 inhibitors in tabular form for side by side comparison.</p><h2 id=Summary><span class=ez-toc-section id=summary-%e2%80%93-cox-1-vs-cox-2-inhibitors></span>Summary –&nbsp;COX 1 vs COX 2 Inhibitors<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify>COX 1 inhibitor and COX 2 inhibitor are two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. They are selective than traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen. COX 1 inhibitor is a drug that inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme. COX 2 inhibitor is a drug that inhibits cyclooxygenase-2. So, this is the key difference between COX 1 inhibitor and COX 2 inhibitor.</p><h5>Reference:</h5><p>1. “Cyclooxygenase 1 Inhibitor.” An Overview | ScienceDirect Topics.<br>2.
