From <a href=#>his series with Oprah Winfrey&nbsp;</a><a href=#>The Me You Can’t See</a>&nbsp;to his Netflix contract and upcoming memoir, Harry is making California his home and entertainment his industry, and we couldn’t be more excited to see what he’ll do now that he’s broken free from his royal role.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Dan Stevens</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AP21248535312571.jpg><p>Oh <a href=#>Dan Stevens</a>, how could we ever forget his incredible performance on Downton Abbey as Matthew. We’re pretty much jealous of everyone who starred in the hit PBS show. Steven’s also played the Beast in the live-action movie of Beauty and the Beast and boy, did he look handsome doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4107551487414><h2>Orlando Bloom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DAN-STEVENS-1.jpg><p>Okay, what isn’t there to be jealous about when it comes to Orlando Bloom? He’s married to the stunning and mega talented, Katy Perry. They <a href=#>welcomed their first child</a>, Daisy Bloom, last year. He’s starred in two of the most popular movie franchises in history – Lord of the Rings and Pirates of the Caribbean.

He’s probably most known for his epic role as Loki in several Marvel films and television shows. Who wouldn’t want to play one of the biggest superhero villians?</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.45296167247387><h2>Regé-Jean Page</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TOM-HIDDLESTON-1.jpg><p>A new addition to our list, Regé-Jean Page, swept the internet by storm with his drop-dead good looks, but also his amazing performace as Simon Basset in the <a href=#>viral hit-series Bridgerton</a>.

It’s no wonder <a href=#>he played Superman</a> in numerous DC films. Most recently, he starred in The Witcher, a Netflix series based on the popular video game of the same name.

Somehow he’s only 49-years-old and getting more handsom every year. Elba, like so many men on our list, has been a part of <a href=#>some awesome projects</a> like the show Luther and many Marvel movies playing the role of Heimdall. Things don’t seem to be slowing down soon for Elba, and we couldn’t be happier to see that.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Daniel Craig</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IDRIS-ELBA.jpg><p>&nbsp;Oh Daniel Craig, the James Bond we’ve known and loved for the past 15 years.
