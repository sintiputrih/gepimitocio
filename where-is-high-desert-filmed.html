<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Where Is High Desert Filmed: Locations Behind the Scenes</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Patricia Arquette plays Peggy Newman in the comedy series “High Desert” on Apple TV+. Following her mother’s untimely death, Peggy resolves to change her life for the better. She decides to change her life and pursue a career in private investigation since she thinks she has what it takes to be successful. The comedy programme, which was created by Nancy Fichman, Katie Ford, and Jennifer Hoppe-House, stars a cast of talented actors, including Brad Garrett, Weruche Opia, Bernadette Peters, and Rupert Friend, in amusing on-screen roles.</p><p>The protagonist occasionally goes from one location to another, and Yucca Valley, a small Californian desert hamlet, serves as the backdrop for all the comic action. The constantly shifting settings represent the profound shifts in Peggy’s life following her mother’s death. So, it makes sense that you would wonder, Where was “High Desert” shot? Let’s investigate the same, shall we?</p><h3>High Desert Filming Locations</h3><p>The film “High Desert” was shot in California, namely in the Greater Los Angeles area. Principal photography for the first version of Patricia Arquette’s film reportedly began in November 2021 and ended in March 2022. The creators allegedly decided to film the series in California to lend some credibility to the story, as the drama is set in a desert hamlet there. Let’s save time now and obtain a thorough rundown of every precise place that may be seen in the Apple TV+ series!</p><h3>Greater Los Angeles, California</h3><p>The Greater Los Angeles area, which consists of five counties: Ventura County, San Bernardino County, Riverside County, Los Angeles County, and Orange County, is where nearly all of the crucial scenes for “High Desert” were shot. Among these are a few Riverside County communities, such Palm Springs and Desert Hot Springs, which are crucial production sites for the comedy series. Another county where the “High Desert” production crew sets up camp for filming is San Bernardino County.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Matt Dillon (@mattdillon)</a></p><p><br>In addition, key scenes from season 1 were observed being recorded in Los Angeles County by the actors and crew. In particular, the communities of Long Beach and Santa Clarita are two LA County filming locations that are featured in multiple scenes of the comedy series. The filmmaking unit apparently used one of the many local film studios’ facilities to tape some of the interior sequences. In addition, a number of sequences prominently feature the western parts of Lancaster and the Sable Ranch in Santa Clarita.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Nancy Fichman (@fichmannancy)</a></p><p>Walt Disney Studios, Universal Studios, Warner Brothers Studios, and The Studios at Paramount are a handful of the largest film studios in Los Angeles County. Regarding the outdoor sequences, it’s possible that the majority were filmed on site in various streets and neighbourhoods within the Greater Los Angeles area against appropriate backdrops by the production team. As a result, you’re probably going to notice that a few well-known locations—like El Pueblo de Los Ángeles Historical Monument, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, Bao Quang Temple, Hollywood Bowl, Venice Beach, and Marina del Rey—are featured as the background of multiple scenes.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c9c5dc8e24ec8d74ae07e882d4c2212b?s=150&d=mp&r=g" height=150 width=150 itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Ayushi S</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><ul><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Best Chick Flicks on HBO Max Right Now: Your Guide to Romantic Movie Nights</span></a></li><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Vanessa Papa The Ultimatum: A Recap of the Drama-Unfolding Reality Show</span></a></li><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Best Indian Shows on Netflix: Exploring Rich and Diverse Cultural Narratives</span></a></li><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Best PG-13 Movies on Netflix: Family-Friendly Entertainment for Various Tastes</span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmicn6mwsLnSraaroZWoe6S7zGiuoZ2imnqqv4yhoKCgXZmytLHRrWSfoZyisqV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-andrews-injury-whats-the-current-situation-with-mark-andrews.html><span>←</span><span>Mark Andrews' Injury: What's the Current Situation with Mark Andrews? - SarkariResult</span></a>
