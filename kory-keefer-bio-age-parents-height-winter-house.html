The two have been friends for years. One day, Kory paid Craig a visit at the Winter House, and basically stayed there ever since.</span></p><p><span>Talking more about their friendship, Kory and Craig met as roomies and were even members of the same fraternity, </span><i><span>Kappa Sigma</span></i><span>, at the College of Charleston. Thereafter, the two “developed a bit of a reputation as the same guy, just in different bodies” and were practically “inseparable.”</span></p><p><span>As per Craig, he initially believed Kory would be alongside him when he was cast on the show. However, despite Craig’s attempts to convenience the producers that Kory would be a good match for Paige, they didn’t cast him.</span></p><p><span>Now talking about Kory’s time in </span><i><span>Winter House</span></i><span>, the guy was described as an “adrenaline junkie” who quickly becomes the “house heartthrob” in the house. He flirted with fellow newcomers Jessica and Rachel, as well as Winter House alum Ciara Miller, and this obviously stirred up some emotion for Austen Kroll.</span></p><p><span>In case you missed it, Austen and Ciara spent the last trip to Vermont romancing Ciara, and have hooked up on and off for less than a year.</span></p><h3><b>Is Kory Keefer Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span>Kory Keefer is likely single as of 2022.
