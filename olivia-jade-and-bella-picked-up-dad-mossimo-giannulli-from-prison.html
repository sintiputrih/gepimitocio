Gianni, who was born before Mossimo met his wife, <a href=#><strong>Lori Loughlin</strong></a>, noted they were allowed to pick up their dad at 8: 30 a.m. on Friday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Olivia-Jade-Bella-Surprised-Mossimo-Ginnnulli-Picked-Him-Up-From-Prison-001.jpg><p>Us Weekly confirmed on Saturday, April 3, that Mossimo, who shares Olivia Jade, 21, and Bella, 22, with the<a href=#> Full House</a> alum, was released “three weeks earlier than planned” after <a href=#>being sentenced to five months in prison</a> for his role in the college admission scandal.</p><p>Mossimo was initially transferred to the RRM Long Beach halfway house, with the Associated Press reporting that he was moved to home confinement on Friday.</p><p>“It’s Lori’s Easter surprise,” a source told Us after the designer was <a href=#>reunited with his wife</a>.</p><p>Both Mossimo and Loughlin, 56, were arrested in March 2019 after being accused of paying $500,000 in bribes to ensure their daughters’ acceptance into the University of Southern California. The <a href=#>pair pleaded guilty in May 2020</a> after previously claiming they were innocent.</p><p>Mossimo was sentenced to serve five months, which he began serving in November 2020. He must also complete 250 hours of community service and had to pay a fine. The actress, for her part, was sentenced to two months at the Federal Correctional Institute in Dublin, California, <a href=#>which she completed in December</a>.</p><p>A source <a href=#>exclusively told Us</a> in February that the <a href=#>former When Calls the Heart star</a> was “due to complete” her 100 hours of community service within the month after working with Project Angel Food and children who have learning disabilities. The couple <a href=#>paid their combined fines</a> in November 2020 and must each complete two years of supervised release.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The California native’s release came as a surprise to some fans after <a href=#>a judge rejected Mossimo’s request in January</a> to be released early and<a href=#> complete his sentence in home confinement instead</a>.</p><p>“Mossimo had to file an emergency motion to get out of solitary because he had no access to anything while inside,” a source told Us at the time after he was transferred to a minimum-security camp the same month and quarantined in solitary for an “extended period” amid COVID-19 concerns. “He didn’t go outside for almost two weeks; he was denied access to everything other than a shower.”</p><p>While Loughlin and her husband, who wed in 1997, have yet to publicly speak out about the college admission scandal, their youngest daughter <a href=#>addressed the controversy in December</a>. Olivia Jade apologized for her family’s actions during an appearance on The Red Table Talk.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaopJmrtqJ5yZqbnmWRo7FursSlo5ploJ6wrLHDZqypZZSWsW65zqyqoqWfYrSqrc2nrKWkmWKzs7vMZqeroaOku3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kyra-lashley-all-about-the-first-daughter-of-bobby-lashley.html><span>←</span><span>Kyra Lashley- All About The First Daughter Of Bobby Lashley</span></a>
