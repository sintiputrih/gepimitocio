The Atlanta, Ga., native’s singing voice was one of the many reasons she was selected to play Ariel. As Rob told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly,</a> he was looking for someone who could be “incredibly strong, passionate, beautiful, smart, clever,” and have “a great deal of fire and joy” — and confirmed Halle checked all of his boxes.</p><p>Since Halle wowed the casting team at her audition, it was only fitting that the singer, who rose to fame alongside her sister <a href=#>Chloe Bailey,</a> as the musical duo <a href=#>Chloe X Halle</a>, also sang when the time came to start shooting the movie.</p><p>Months before The Little Mermaid premiered, fans received a teaser of Halle singing one of the film’s staple tunes, “Part of Your World.” The Disney favorite was popularized in 1989 when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jodi Benson</a> sang it for Disney’s original Little Mermaid.</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Disney</a></figure><p>While Halle knew she had some big shoes to fill, she delivered in both the movie’s clip and several live performances of the song on shows like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Idol</a>. The musical pro told us that singing as Ariel was a breeze, but working on something without her biological BFF, Chloe, was the “most challenging” part of the journey for her.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>“I think the most challenging thing for me was definitely just coming into my own and realizing that this was a very big movie that I'm taking under my wings as an independent, individual, human being and artist,” Halle exclusively told Distractify. “Because I'm very used to working with my older sister [Chloe], my angel, who's been my rock my whole life.”</p><p>“She's always kind of been right next to me to hold my hand every step of the way,” she added. “And so this was the first thing I ever had to do alone. So it really taught me a lot about myself. And it allowed me to find myself and who I am independently.”</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Halle said she’s “so so excited” for ‘The Little Mermaid’ fans to hear the movie’s new and classic songs.</h2><p>In addition to “Part of Your World,” moviegoers will hear another song from Ariel that wasn’t in the original Disney cartoon. The song <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“For The First Time”</a> was one of the three debut songs written by the film’s musical team — <a href=#>Alan Menken</a> and <a href=#>Lin Manuel Miranda</a>.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>Alan was the original composer for The Little Mermaid in 1989 with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Ashman</a>, and the duo won two Oscars in 1990 for the classic “Under the Sea” before Howard died in 1991. For the 2023 version, Alan collaborated with Lin, who is best known for creating the Broadway sensation Hamilton and scoring several Disney films.</p><p>Lin and Alan created new songs and changed several of Howard’s lyrics to reflect the current times better. The composers changed the lyrics to “Poor Unfortunate Souls” and “Kiss the Girl” to allow Ariel to be less thirsty for Eric’s (Jonah Hauer-King) kiss and allow them to fall in love naturally.</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Little Mermaid (@disneylittlemermaid)</a></p></figure><p>While the songs may not sound the same as the ones many grew up with, Halle said she’s looking forward to fans seeing what changed from the film and what remained the same.</p><p>“It was cool collaborating with them when they worked on the new songs for the film,” Halle told us of working with her musical team. “And then, as you know, the original songs are still the same song we all know and love.
