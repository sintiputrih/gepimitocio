Alan Dershowitz specializes in American constitutional and criminal law. He is best recognized for handling high-profile cases for controversial clients such as Julian Assange, Mike Tyson, Patty Hearst, and Harvey Weinstein. Dershowitz also worked on the legal teams for O. J. Simpson, Donald Trump, and Jeffrey Epstein. In 2014, one of Epstein’s victims accused him of rape.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Alan Dershowitz?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Alan Dershowitz </a>was born on September 1, 1938, in Brooklyn, New York City, to Orthodox Jewish parents Claire and Harry. He had his first job at 14, working in a deli factory on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Dershowitz attended the boys’ preparatory school Yeshiva University High School, w here he played basketball.</p><p>After graduation, he enrolled at Brooklyn College, where he received an AB in political science in 1959. Dershowitz later attended Yale Law School, where he was the editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal. In 1962, he finished first in his class with a bachelor of law degree.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old is Alan Dershowitz?</h2><p>He is currently 85 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Alan Dershowitz’s net worth?</h2><p>He is estimated to be worth $20 Million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Alan Dershowitz’s career?</h2><p>Following his graduation from Yale, Dershowitz clerked for the chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, David L. Bazelon. Following that, he clerked for Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg for a year.</p><p>Dershowitz joined Harvard Law School as an assistant professor in 1964, and three years later, at the age of 28, he was promoted to full-time professor, making him the youngest professor in the school’s history. Dershowitz would continue to teach at Harvard Law for four decades, retiring in 2013.</p><p>While teaching at Harvard, Dershowitz continued to practice civil and criminal law. He handled one of his first important cases in 1984, representing Claus von Bülow, a British socialite convicted of attempting to murder his wife. Dershowitz successfully reversed the conviction, and the case served as the basis for his book “Reversal of Fortune,” which was eventually adapted into an Oscar-winning film.</p><p>Dershowitz had another high-profile case in 1995 when he worked as an appellate adviser for O. J. Simpson’s defense team during the football star’s murder trial. Dershowitz’s other notorious clients were American businesswoman Leona Helmsley, televangelist fraudster Jim Bakker, professional boxer Mike Tyson, and investor Michael Milken.</p><p>Dershowitz had a number of unpopular clients during the 2000s. In 2006, he was a member of the legal defense team in the first criminal case against sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Dershowitz assisted in successfully negotiating a non-prosecution deal on Epstein’s behalf. Later, in 2011, Dershowitz worked as a consultant for Julian Assange’s legal team, who was facing charges from the US government for leaking sensitive documents through WikiLeaks.</p><p>Another contentious issue arose seven years later when Dershowitz joined the legal team representing Hollywood producer and sex abuser Harvey Weinstein. He gained additional notoriety and ire in 2020 when he joined the legal team defending Donald Trump in his first impeachment.</p><p>This was all the more contentious because Dershowitz had backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and had strongly condemned Trump before his win. Furthermore, in his oral arguments, he made assertions that contradicted his previous stances on Bill Clinton’s impeachment. Following the trial, Dershowitz faced further criticism for using his links to Trump’s administration to push for the mercy of several of his clients.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpqjmqZdmbKzv8eorqKsqmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./will-sevin-dust-get-rid-of-japanese-beetles-html.html><span>←</span><span>Will Sevin dust get rid of Japanese beetles?</span></a>
