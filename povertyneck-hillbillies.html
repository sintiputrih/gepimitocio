Five years later, The PovertyNeck Hillbillies are a six member band formed from the roots of talent, ambition and a genuine passion for country music. Chris Higbee (fiddle), Abby (lead vocals), Dave Cramer (keyboards, vocals), Ryan Lucotch (drums), Jeff Volek (bass), and Junior (electric guitar) are the magic six from the outskirts of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that make this group unlike any other country act that is out there.</p><p>The charismatic, live performances that The PovertyNeck Hillbillies deliver night after night to thousands of fans of all ages and cowboy boot sizes are a true testament to why this group is the greatest new band in the world of country music. Abby's vocals blend a deep, country twang with a hint of rocknroll gravel, and are backed by powerful harmonies in songs such as, "She Rides Wild Horses" and "Mr. Right Now." The six piece band provides the full, articulate sound that makes The PovertyNeck Hillbillies unique in their genre.</p><p>As the official band of the Pittsburgh Steelers, PNH has a deep loyalty to their hometown soil, where in 2005 their debut release sold over 2,100 units in the first week of distribution. "Hillbilly State of Mind" sold over 30,000 units regionally, attracting national attention from the Country Music Association, who promptly named the band one of the "top independent artists of 2005."</p><p>Producer/manager, Bob Corbin (Kenny Rogers, Hank Williams Jr. and Alabama) has been with the band since the beginning and is the songwriter behind some of the album's greatest tunes. The album will hit stores on June 6th, 2006 and will come with a bonus two hour DVD featuring a live concert/documentary, produced by WQED in Pittsburgh. The documentary has been in syndicated rotation on PBS stations in over twenty states nationwide. As regional heavyweights with national radio, television and media attention, The PovertyNeck Hillbillies are rapidly becoming country music's fastest rising stars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifKK%2B06KqrWeApMOmvtOypZ6bm5SVqrjLm6ClpJmawA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natalie-portman-clues-benjamin-millepied-marriage-off.html><span>←</span><span>Natalie Portman Had Clues That Benjamin Millepied Marriage Was Off</span></a>
