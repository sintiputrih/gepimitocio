When that shared universe happens to involve <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Frankenstein</a> and has its keys given to one of the most influential horror maestros of our time, however, it’s a different story.</p><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=813 data-injectable=true>Indeed, we were all ready to line up for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guillermo del Toro</a>‘s take on the classic monster (not to be confused with the doctor), but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the idea of granting him access to the rest</a> of the Universal Monster library – the odds of which are reportedly more than zero – is enough for us to at least mostly cast aside the trauma that was the initial attempt at the Monster Universe and look ahead to what could be an unprecedented step forward for the horror genre.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>When in doubt, adapt Journey to the West</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-monkey-king.jpg><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>Forty adaptations in 23 years apparently hasn’t deterred Netflix from placing their bets on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Monkey King</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an upcoming animated feature film due to hit queues on August 18</a>; in fact, the streamer seems to take some sort of perverted glee in adding on to the dense collection of Journey to the West-inspired projects, if only for the cheeky way in which it allows the streamer to spit on the notion of originality.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>It can’t be knocked too harshly just yet, of course; at a glance, it seems like completely harmless family entertainment that will at least do its job on the charts before fading into obscurity, but especially in a world that’s somehow both obsessed with and repulsed by the industry’s fixation on IP, there’s no shame in feeling lukewarm about this one.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Want Netflix to stop cancelling your favorite shows? Too bad, here’s a sports docuseries instead</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/alex-morgan-e1689609534138.jpg><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>But even when Netflix does dip its toes into something a bit more adventurous, a sour taste is still unavoidable if it jumps to new projects without finishing the ones they have going on.</p><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>To the streamer’s credit, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a docuseries about the United States women’s national soccer team</a>, which houses some of the most intriguing and dynamic sports personalities in the world, definitely sounds like a worthwhile watch. Still, as Netflix continues to wield the cancelation axe with impunity, you have to wonder just how sincerely (or not) the streamer approaches each new project, and whether or not every new show is just another broken toy waiting to happen.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo5qslajBbrrErZ2loahiu6bD0maYp2WRmLCtrcimnJ1lmKS%2Fs7vRZqqeqpmawG6ty6amrKxdqMKnssSrnJ1lkWLBpr7Rop2yoZ6ceqet055kmqtdo7K1ssuir2akn6S4tHnTqGSrnaOprrPAjK2fnmWfobGmv9NmmqKmlaKutbXCZqynoaaav7SxjKKlZqCZqMGwvtho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./752862-benny-the-butcher-griselda-relationship-breakup-rumors-family.html><span>←</span><span>Benny The Butcher Clarifies Griselda's Relationship Amid Breakup Rumors: &amp;quot;We're Family&amp;quot;</span></a>
