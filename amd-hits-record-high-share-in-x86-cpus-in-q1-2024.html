After the company launched its Ryzen processors in 2017, it doubled its presence in desktops in just three years. But in the recent years the company had to prioritize production of more expensive CPUs for datacenters, which lead to some erosion of its desktop and mobile market shares.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/21392/cpu-mkt-shares-q1-2024-mercury-desktops.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>As the company secured more capacity at TSMC, it started to gradually increase production of desktop processors. In Q4 last year it introduced its Zen 4-based Ryzen 8000/Ryzen 8000 Pro processors for mainstream desktops, which appeared to be pretty popular with PC makers.</p><p>As a result of this and other factors, AMD increased unit sales of its desktop CPUs by 4.7% year-over-year in Q1 2024 and its market share achieved 23.9%, which is the highest desktop CPU market share the company commanded in over a decade. Interestingly, AMD does not attribute its success on the desktop front to any particular product or product family, which implies that there are multiple factors at play.</p><h3>Mobile PCs: A Slight Drop for AMD amid Intel's Meteor Lake Ramp</h3><p>AMD has been gradually regaining its share inside laptops for about 1.5 years now and sales of its Zen 4-based Ryzen 7040-series processors were quite strong in Q3 2023 and Q4 2023, when the company's unit share increased to 19.5% and 20.3%, respectively, as AMD-based notebook platforms ramped up. By contrast, Intel's Core Ultra 'Meteor Lake' powered machines only began to hit retail shelves in Q4'23, which affected sales of its processors for laptops.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/21392/cpu-mkt-shares-q1-2024-mercury-mobile.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In the first quarter AMD's unit share on the market of CPUs for notebooks decreased to 19.3%, down 1% sequentially. Meanwhile, the company still demonstrated significant year-over-year unit share increase of 3.1% and revenue share increase of 4%, which signals rising average selling price of AMD's latest Ryzen processors for mobile PCs.</p><h3>Client PCs: Slight Gain for AMD, Small Loss for Intel</h3><p>Overall, Intel remained the dominant force in client PC sales in the first quarter of 2024, with a 79.4% market share, leaving 20.6% for AMD. This is not particularly surprising given how strong and diverse Intel's client products lineup is. Even with continued success, it will take AMD years to grow sales by enough to completely flip the market.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/21392/cpu-mkt-shares-q1-2024-mercury-client.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>But AMD actually gained a 0.3% unit share sequentially and a 3.6% unit share year-over year. Notably, however, AMD's revenue share of client PC market is significantly lower than its unit share (16.3% vs 20.6%), so the company is still somewhat pigeonholed into selling more budget and fewer premium processors overall. But the company still made a strong 3.8% gain since the first quarter 2023, when its revenue share was around 12.5% amid unit share of 17%.</p><h3>Servers: AMD Grabs Another Piece of the Market</h3><p>AMD's EPYC datacenter processors are undeniably the crown jewel of the company's CPU product lineup. While AMD's market share in desktops and laptops fluctuated in the recent years, the company has been steadily gaining presence in servers both in terms of units and in terms of revenue in the highly lucrative (and profitable) server market.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/21392/cpu-mkt-shares-q1-2024-mercury-server.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In Q1 2024, AMD's unit share on the market of CPUs for servers increased to 23.6%, a 0.5% gain sequentially and a massive 5% gain year-over-year driven by the ramp of platforms based on AMD's 4th&nbsp;Generation EPYC processors. With a 76.4% unit market share, Intel continues to dominate in servers, but it is evident that AMD is getting stronger.</p><p>AMD's revenue share of the x86 server market reached 33%, up 5.2% year-over-year and 1.2% from the previous quarter. This signals that the company is gaining traction in expensive machines with advanced CPUs. Keeping in mind that for now Intel does not have direct rivals for AMD's 96-core and 128-core processors, it is no wonder that AMD has done so well growing their share of the server market.</p><p>"As we noted during our first quarter earnings call, server CPU sales increased YoY driven by growth in enterprise adoption and expanded cloud deployments," AMD said in a statement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH9yf5hrZpqllGK1qsDSZqmem5%2BnsW60yKCfZquYlr%2BmecinZLFwZmKwscHSZqCnZaFmenN8kW0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-macy-gray.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Macy Gray?</span></a>
