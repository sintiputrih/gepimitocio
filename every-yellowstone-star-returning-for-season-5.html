Paramount’s <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellowstone</a></strong> kicks off season 5 this November, and it’s going to be a wild ride.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>While audiences worldwide will be tuning in, viewers aren’t the only ones returning to Yellowstone. The western drama highlights the tumultuous relationships with the Dutton family, the fight they’re up against, and the romance and lust that add an intoxicating spin to the storyline. The cast of characters that keep us coming back weekly has been working hard to serve us an exciting fifth season.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=202 data-injectable=false>Patriarch John Dutton, played by the one and only Kevin Costner, heads the ranch, but his entire operation would be for naught if it weren’t for his family, be it by blood or deeply-rooted trust.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>John’s relationship with his sons and daughter is often turbulent. Still, there’s a level of respect for the family name — and, dare we say it, love for one another — that surpasses even the most profound anger and betrayal.</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=203 data-injectable=false>From Beth and Kayce, to Rip and Jamie, and even Chief Thomas Rainwater and Lloyd Pierce, Dutton requires those around him to work like a well-oiled machine, each feeling the weight of the part they play.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>The all-encompassing privilege of being a part of the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch is etched into the skin of several ranch hands — quite literally. If they’ve been deemed worthy, wearing the brand signifies several things — including being part of a loyal brotherhood.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>From family to foe, the cast of Yellowstone fit perfectly together to tell an epic love story, despite the harrowing villainy afoot. With season 5 on the horizon, set to add <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">several new characters</a>, which fan favorites are returning to the Yellowstone Dutton ranch?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-returning-to-yellowstone data-injectable=false>Who is returning to Yellowstone?</h2><h2 data-injectable=false>Kevin Costner — John Dutton</h2><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>“Learn to be meaner than evil and still love your family and enjoy a sunrise.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kevin Costner & Modern West (@kevincostnermodernwest)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>The infamous Kevin Costner continues to bring patriarch John Dutton to Yellowstone as season 5 rolls on. John wears the role of ranch owner with the same pride he wears the role of father — and the same grit.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>He’s constantly in battle, be it with himself or with those trying to impede on his land or his family — the man rarely takes a second to take a deep breath, but it’s not something he rules out completely. For each battle he faces, there’s a sunrise with a horse waiting to explore the ranch.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>John is as wise as he is kind, but rough around the edges. As he continues to explore dynamics within his family, romance, and foes — we’re sure there are still layers of the man to uncover.</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Season 5 should be an interesting one for the man who stands at the center of it all, and we can’t wait to see it unfold.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Luke Grimes — Kayce Dutton</h2><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>“Soldiers don’t tell war stories anymore, Dad, because wars these days, it’s just about trying to live through them.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Yellowstone (@yellowstone)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>Luke Grimes plays Kayce Dutton so well that you almost forget they’re not the same person. Of course, that’s the goal of every actor who receives a part, but there’s something so intricately connected between Kayce and Luke.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>Kayce realizes the importance of keeping the family name — and the ranch — in high regard. The fight for power doesn’t exist between John and Kayce; they share a respect for their jobs on the ranch, and Kayce respects his father for his sacrifices.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>Kayce is also a husband to his wife, Monica, and a father to their son, Tate. While their lives haven’t been easy, some of that is because of the Dutton name; they find ways to connect. Kayce is a giver, and he’s most recently been on a spiritual quest that is opening doors, some of which are frightening, making season 5 likely his most personal and impactful.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Cole Hauser — Rip Wheeler</h2><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=113 data-injectable=false>“There’s sharks and minnows in this world. If you don’t know which you are, you ain’t a shark.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Cole Hauser (@colehauser22)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>If the last name doesn’t give it away, Rip Wheeler isn’t a blood relation to the Duttons, but that doesn’t make him any less familial. John sees Wheeler as a son, someone he trusts with his life and his ranch, and someone he sees as good enough for his daughter, Beth.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>Yep, the infamous Rip and Beth love story is possible because Cole Hauser brings grit, determination, and an unexpected softness to Yellowstone. His character is the first in line to take someone to the train station, or to play a slow song on the radio across the ranch for the woman he loves.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>In terms of the ranch hands, Wheeler also ensures that they’re kept in line. In addition to their duties around the ranch, they have responsibilities to one another and the Dutton name. If anyone steps out of line, Wheeler is going to get them right back in.</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>Wheeler’s responsibilities aren’t easy, in fact — next to John, he’s got one of the most demanding jobs on the ranch, which goes back to that family aspect. He’s on a level of trust that so few will ever have with the Dutton family, and as a newly-married man (yes, we cried when we heard “I do” from Rip and Beth), he’s going to be a busy man in season 5.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Kelly Reilly — Beth Dutton</h2><p data-characters=57 data-current-count=57 data-injectable=false>“You are the trailer park, I am the tornado.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Yellowstone (@yellowstone)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>It’s hard to describe Beth Dutton. In fact, it’s nearly impossible. She’s got the best one-liners across the entire series, the most badass attitude, and an inherent softness that only exists within the walls of the cabin that she shares with Rip.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Beth has been through a lot — and it’s all shaped her into a powerful woman who isn’t afraid to bite before she barks. There’s no wondering what you get with Beth Dutton; if she doesn’t say it in words, her face will. She walks into a room commanding attention, and it doesn’t take but a second before all eyes are on her.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>With a story as heart-wrenching as it is full of beauty, Kelly Reilly brings a determination to Beth that only she could work in. The character we all know, love, and strive to be like is intense, passionate, and determined — and a little fiery after a glass of her favorite alcohol after a long day.</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>As a newly-married woman, and having gone on a pretty intense mission, season 5 will be full of ups and downs for Beth — and hopefully more sweet moments with Rip!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Wes Bentley — Jamie Dutton</h2><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>“I need you to forget how we feel about each other and remember one thing – we’re family.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Yellowstone (@yellowstone)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Jamie Dutton might not be your first pick for favorite Dutton family member, but Wes Bentley brings a likability to him, despite the less-than-stellar actions he normally finds himself taking part in. As Yellowstone unfolds, fans also learn a secret about Jamie, and it’s pretty intense — his tie to the Duttons isn’t what it seems.</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=821 data-injectable=true>Of course, his antics start long before fans learn that nugget of information about Jamie, so the secret doesn’t hinge on him being a good or a bad person. He is who he is all of his own accord; and who he is, is not as in sync with the rest of the Duttons as one might imagine. The closed circle becomes penetrable where Jamie is concerned. He’s not all negative, though — he’s actually got some redeeming moments, though they’re not easy to see.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>At the conclusion of season 4, Jamie did something monumental, drawing a line in the sand, so to speak, where loyalty is involved. Jamie made a choice, and it was a big one. Season 5 will largely hinge on that the very turning point of Jamie’s big choice.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Kelsey Asbille — Monica Long Dutton</h2><p data-characters=80 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>“I can’t think of a better medicine than the stars for a ceiling.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Yellowstone (@yellowstone)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>As the Dutton family grows, the stories get more complex, and part of that complexity is explained through Monica Long Dutton, played by the talented Kelly Asbille. Wife of Kayce, she’s a holder of the Dutton name, but their relationship is multilayered — there’s a lot on the line.</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>Before she was a Dutton, Long grew up on a ranch of her own on the Broken Rock Indian Reservation, and her path with the Duttons crossed long before she met Kayce. What initially linked them was a tragedy for both families.</p><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>So who is Monica outside of that? She’s a teacher, a mother, a wife, and a friend — and she’s torn between two halves of herself; the one who understands what it means to feel the Duttons’ protection, and the other who wishes to fight against the pull to that side of her family. She’s Native to the land, granddaughter to Broken Rock Reservation elder Felix Long, and she’s still trying to understand how to recognize and honor both parts of herself.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>Season 5 will weigh heavily on Monica, in addition to Kayce’s spiritual journey — she’s also expecting once more. There are a lot of changes on the horizon for the couple, and it’ll be an interesting ride to see how they play out.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Brecken Merrill — Tate Dutton</h2><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>“I need to talk to you first, grandpa. It’s very serious. So I’ve made a decision, I’m going to be a cowboy.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Yellowstone (@yellowstone)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>Tate Dutton, played by Brecken Merrill, is the son of Kayce and Monica. Much like the other characters living on the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch, he’s dealt with more turmoil than anyone at his age should, but as we all know, children are resilient, and he’s managed to find some solace in Yellowstone.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true>All Monica and Kayce have hoped for Tate is for him to be safe and at home on the land, to be sure of who he is, and to know that he is loved. As the Dutton family, specifically Kayce and Monica’s, work on strengthening relationships, they’ll grow their family and continue to live out the legacy they build more each day.</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=167 data-injectable=false>Tate is certainly a boy with a draw to the ranch and life as a cowboy; it’ll be interesting to see how he continues to grow, especially alongside a new sibling.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Wendy Moniz — Governor Lynelle Perry</h2><p data-characters=68 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>“Bullies need to be big, and I’m bigger than you.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Wendy Moniz (@wendymonizofficial)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=139 data-injectable=false>Look, if anyone deserves a safe place to land, it’s John Dutton. Governor Lynelle Perry provides that for him, in more ways than one.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>Wendy Moniz brings the character to life, and for every ounce of power and confidence she exudes, she also needs the bond that she and John have formed. He provides her with a comfortable place to let her hair down, take off her business suit, and share time with someone who gets it.</p><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=133 data-injectable=false>Their careers are different but similar, as they constantly have the world on their shoulders, and worry about making one wrong move.</p><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>Season 4 ended with Perry making a decision that would impact not just her future but John’s, and we can’t wait to see what’s next for them.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Forrie J. Smith — Lloyd Pierce</h2><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>“It’s the shame that hurts the most, you know? But shame, it’s in the mind. You can turn that faucet off whenever you want to.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Yellowstone (@yellowstone)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>One of the most seasoned ranch hands on the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch, Lloyd Pierce is brought to life by Forrie J Smith. Everyone knows Lloyd, almost everyone loves Lloyd, but he’s not the crowd favorite for every person on the ranch — specifically for a ranch hand named Walker.</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>The two have been at odds about a woman named Laramie, who had relations with both men, but ultimately picked Walker. It was certainly a blow to the ego, but there was more to it than that. Lloyd has been a ranch hand for some time, the closest to the Duttons, and someone who values being a respected man on the ranch.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>The physical altercation between Lloyd and Walker most certainly left a sour taste in his mouth, and things with him were touch and go for a while. No one was ready to lose their favorite ranch hand just yet, and we all hope season 5 proves to be more of a peaceful experience.
