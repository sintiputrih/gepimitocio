She was then assisted by the Sun Pirates to return to her home. Despite the deep trauma of her time being a slave under Mary Geoise, Koala made the choice to join the Revolutionary Army at the age of 14 and soon rose up the ranks in the organization.

Vinsmoke Reiju</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=696 data-current-count=996 data-injectable=true>Elder sister of Sanji and the only daughter of the Vinsmoke family, Reiju is the princess of the Germa Kingdom. She is also a commander in the kingdom’s military army, Germa 66. Due to her possession of poison-based powers, she is popularly called Poison Pink. Unlike her cruel brothers, Reiju is kind and empathetic. Her affection for Sanji is often masked with a callous demeanor which comes as a result of their father’s obvious disdain for compassion. During the entire Whole Cake Island arc, Reiju was an ally of the Straw Hat Pirates and soon became a fan favorite. Her internal struggle to reconcile her family’s dark past with her own morality makes her a fascinating character.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. Nefertari Vivi</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=667 data-current-count=967 data-injectable=true>From princess to spy, Vivi is the daughter of Nefertari Cobra and Titi.

She is shown to be uncorrupted unlike the other Marine Officers and follows a righteous path. She looks very similar to Zoro’s late friend Kuina, which shocked Zoro when he first encountered her.

She not only had the ability to manipulate human souls because of her Devil Fruit power but could also use all three types of haki, making her one of the most powerful characters in the show. Big Mom’s terrifying strength and control over the “Whole Cake Island” are balanced by her complex personality and tragic backstory. Her presence as both a villain and a mother figure highlights the intricate weaving of character arcs in One Piece.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. Boa Hancock</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=658 data-current-count=958 data-injectable=true>Boa Hancock is a former warlord and the only female to become a Warlord of the seas.

Robin’s enigmatic past and her connection to the world’s lost history make her a vital character in the series.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>1. Nami</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=588 data-current-count=888 data-injectable=false>Topping our list, of course, is the beloved Nami.
