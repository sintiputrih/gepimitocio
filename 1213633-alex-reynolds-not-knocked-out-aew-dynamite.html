The duo reflected on the Dark Order, the infamous AEW Dynamite where Reynolds got knocked out, and more. While it seemed like Reynolds was knocked out in the ring on the October 21 episode of AEW Dynamite, he now says he was completely aware of what was going on and everything was planned.</p><p>“I was lying in the middle of the ring, waiting for Private Party to hit Event Omega, which is a combination splash/leg drop off the top rope. And yeah, I got kind of rocked. It is what it is, but what many people online don’t know, or obviously because they weren’t in the situation [is], I wasn’t knocked out,” Reynolds explained, “I was awake the whole time, remembered everything, knew where I was, knew what was going on in the match.”</p><p>“I literally did like a self-check of myself like alright, fingers, toes, I knew I was like okay. The big thing everyone was complaining about was Pepper [Parks,] The Blade-like dragging me to the corner. That was all called. What people aren’t understanding is that I just took a double-team move, whether I got hurt or not, off the top rope in a four-way tag. So in order to win the match, you have to be legal,” Reynolds said. “So Pepper just drags me to his corner so he can become legal and try to win the match. I was just laying there because I was selling this incredible [move] but I also was you know, I was rocked. But I was just kind of making sure I was okay. People sit back and watch it with the knowledge that I’m already hurt. So it’s like, ‘Well, they handled it wrong.’ No, They handled it perfectly, so thankfully I’m okay and cleared and ready to go.”</p><p>Reynolds initially <a href=# rel=noopener>commented on</a>&nbsp;the incident a few days after it took place, stating&nbsp;the referee and ringside doctor acted appropriately in taking care of him, and he feels safe with the team in AEW.</p><p>Hey guys, just wanted to thank you for all the concerns for my health. It means the world to me. I truly believe the ref and our doctor handled the situation great on Wednesdays [sic] show. Injuries happen in wrestling, but I feel completely safe with our team here. Thanks again and I’m looking forward to seeing you soon.</p><p>If you use any portion of this transcription, please credit Colin Tessier of WrestleZone.com&nbsp;</p><p>The full episode is available here:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFqam9rY2KurbHXZqmesZ6kuaW%2FjKemrWWbo7ykt8SdZKitpGKupsOMnbCnmZ2ewaY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./979095-wwe-congratulates-nxt-uk-star-the-bella-twins-give-maryse-and-miz-a-baby-gift-video.html><span>←</span><span>WWE Congratulates NXT UK Star, The Bella Twins Give Maryse And Miz A Baby Gift (Video)</span></a>
