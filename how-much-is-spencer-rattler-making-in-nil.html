The NCAA announced the NIL rules in July 2021, and since then, college athletes have been signing endorsement deals, selling merchandise, and making appearances to earn money from their personal brand.</p><p>Spencer Rattler, the starting quarterback for the University of Oklahoma Sooners, is among the college <a href=#>athletes</a> who are likely to benefit significantly from the new NIL rules. Rattler is a highly skilled player who has gained a considerable following due to his performance on the field and his social media presence. Rattler has over 200,000 followers on Instagram, which gives him a significant platform to promote products and services.</p><p>While the exact amount that Rattler is earning from NIL deals is not publicly available, it is clear that he has signed several deals with businesses in the Oklahoma area. For example, he has signed with Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers, a popular fast-food chain in Oklahoma, to promote the company on his social media accounts. Additionally, he has partnered with OU Health, a healthcare provider in Oklahoma, to promote its services.</p><p>It is worth noting that the amount of money that college athletes can earn from NIL deals varies widely depending on several factors, including the athlete's performance on the field, their social media following, and their personal brand. Some athletes may earn only a few hundred dollars from a single endorsement deal, while others may earn millions of dollars.</p><p>However, it is important to note that <a href=#>college</a> athletes must navigate the NIL landscape with caution to comply with the rules set by the NCAA and their respective universities. For example, athletes cannot use their university's logo or branding in their promotions, and they must disclose their NIL deals to their universities. Additionally, athletes cannot receive payment for their performance on the field, and they cannot promote products or services that are illegal or inconsistent with the values of their universities.</p><p>In conclusion, while the exact amount that Spencer Rattler is making from NIL deals is not publicly available, it is clear that he is among the college athletes who are likely to benefit significantly from the new NIL rules. The new rules offer college <a href=#>athletes</a>, including Rattler, the opportunity to monetize their success and gain recognition in the sports world. However, it is crucial for student-athletes to navigate the NIL landscape with caution and comply with the rules set by the NCAA and their universities.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6hprBlnaqwqXnIrGSsqJWjsKa%2BjKuYraycmr9uucCkoKefXZ67brrIpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hook-heres-what-rufio-looks-like-now.html><span>←</span><span>Here's What Rufio Looks Like Now</span></a>
