From 1979 to 1983, Kenneth Chesebro attended Northwestern University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.).

The committee plans to suggest that former President Donald Trump be charged with a crime in relation to his alleged involvement in the events of January 6, particularly those related to the Capitol rebellion.</p><p>These suggestions are expected to contain at least three charges against Trump: rebellion, obstructing an official action demanded by Congress, and conspiring to defraud the United States. No official announcement regarding the type of criminal referrals has been made, and no representative with the necessary authority has confirmed or discussed the matter in public.</p><p>It is expected that the Justice Department will collaborate with the committee to send letters containing the referrals.
