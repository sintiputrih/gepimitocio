Instead, she launched her own clothing company called <a href=#>Wyllis</a>. Knowing herself how hard it is to live with mental health issues as well as body image issues, Wyllis is a means to help build people up in an industry that tears people down. <a href=#>The company site, which features resources for people in crisis</a>, states, "Our foundation is a vintage inspired curation, marrying the past to the bodies of today."</p><p dir=ltr>Tallulah lived with body dysmorphia for years, especially after spending so much of her life in the spotlight and comparing herself to mom Demi Moore. In a May 2021&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;post, she touched on her image issues, writing, "I was/am inherently valuable and worthy, at any life stage, at any size, with anyhair do! (As are you)."&nbsp;As <a href=#>The Sun</a> reported, she's also opened up on Instagram Stories about being emotionally abused&nbsp;and manipulated by someone she not only lived with, but knew for most of her life. "My very real mental health issues were manipulated and falsified for job security, and an unlimited credit card," she wrote.</p><p>Because Tallulah knows what it's like to struggle with oneself, <a href=#>she does a lot of promoting self love</a> and acceptance in her vulnerability as well as her work with Wyllis.</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, please contact the <a href=#>Crisis Text Line</a> by texting HOME to 741741, call the <a href=#>National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> helpline at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264), or visit the <a href=#>National Institute of Mental Health website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWtoaH52e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2Xv7avxGauoqScnsBussivnGackaq0qcDEq6po</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-beverly-tay-k-father.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Kevin Beverly, Tay-Ks Father: What We Know</span></a>
