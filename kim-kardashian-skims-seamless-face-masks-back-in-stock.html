Over the past decade or so, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she’s constantly evolved</a> and has now cemented herself as a true <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">fashion icon</a>, setting the tone for trends that inevitably <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">take over every season</a>.</p><p>Last year, the reality TV staple cemented her mark in the fashion industry by <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">creating a line</a> of streamlined shapewear known as Skims. The foundation of a fabulous outfit often depends on the garments that you wear underneath it, which is why Kardashian created the bestselling brand. As Skims continues to churn out popular products, they have also been doing their part to help keep everyone safe during the COVID-19 pandemic by <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">created a line of face masks</a> that fit perfectly with the Skims aesthetic. We couldn’t be more excited that these simple, seamless masks are finally back in stock!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seamless-Face-Mask-Sand.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Seamless Face Mask</a> for <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">$8</a> or pick up <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">4 for $25 </a>from SKIMS!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians star launched Skims because she saw a void in the market. There wasn’t shapewear available that addressed her needs directly, so Skims became known for creating pieces that truly enhance the body and come in a wide variety of shades. Their <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Seamless Face Mask</a> is their latest addition to the minimalist-inspired collection!</p><p>These masks come in <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">five neutral shades</a> that complement different skin tones. You can pick one up that’s a perfect match, or simply buy whichever option you prefer. These masks were created from a super soft material that’s breathable and easy to wear. Of course, masks don’t claim to fully <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">prevent the spread of disease</a> — but they can significantly reduce exposure for both yourself and others, especially if you or someone you encounter happens to be an asymptomatic carrier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seamless-Face-Mask-Sienna.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Seamless Face Mask</a> for <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">$8</a> or pick up <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">4 for $25 </a>from SKIMS!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The CDC recommends that <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">everyone wear a face mask</a>, especially in a situation where you can’t maintain proper social distancing. It’s especially important to wear masks indoors in public places, because there’s minimal free-flowing air in contained spaces like grocery stores.</p><p>Best of all, Skims is helping out by creating <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">these masks</a> and donating 10,000 of them to a variety of crucial organizations that need support. This includes Baby2Baby, the Good+ Foundation, the LA Food Bank and the National Domestic Workers Alliance. Based on the strong reviews, it’s clear that shoppers are seriously <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">obsessed with these masks</a> — and we love that Skims is committed to aiding their community on all fronts. Plus, aren’t they simply adorable? They will go with every single summer outfit, and effortlessly take Us into fall in style!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Seamless Face Mask</a> for <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">$8</a> or pick up <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">4 for $25 </a>from SKIMS!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Not what you’re looking for?
