She revealed she began having substance issues after her parents got divorced.</p><p>She referred to spending time in rehab before telling the camera she didn’t feel she needed to go to a facility. However, her father Master P urged her to get professional help to make sure she “stays on track”. He told cameras:</p><p>I really hope TyTy is serious about making a change. In my house, I’m a drill sergeant because you need somebody to tame you and tell you ‘I’m gonna fix this’. If you need to get help, we’re here for you.</p><p>Just weeks before Tytyana’s death, Master P submitted documents that requested a judge declare him legally single.
