But she tells us: "Frank and I have never talked about that."</p><p id=eAgRu6dRfE0 data-wc=55>It is, she adds "really important to keep all the work separate". "Being from my family, over the years, people have always come up to me and said: 'I've worked with your mum,' or: 'I've worked with your aunty [Lynne Redgrave],' and it's quite nice if it's just fresh and there's no history or baggage."</p><p id=eMwDXX2EyGl data-wc=41>As her only daughter Daisy Bevan, 31, from her nine-year marriage to film producer Tim, becomes the fifth generation of her family to embark on the profession, Joely says the tide does seem to be turning for women as they age.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5b09559e3025-joely-richardson-umbrella.jpg><p id=eb8ovhOH105 data-wc=45>"With women over 55, no one's like: 'Yes, I want her on my books!'" she says.
