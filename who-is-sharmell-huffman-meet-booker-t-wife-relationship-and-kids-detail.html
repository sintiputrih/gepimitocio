<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Who Is Sharmell Huffman | Meet Booker T Wife | Relationship And Kids Detail</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Booker T’s wife, Sharmell Huffman, married the WWE wrestler in 2005. The wrestlers’ twins were born in 2010. Booker had previously married before marrying Sharmell, but he fell in love with a woman he met in the late 1990s.</strong></p><p>They aided each other’s careers and finally rose to prominence in the wrestling world. Sharmell has been largely missing from the wrestling scene. A recent episode, however, shows that wrestling fans have not forgotten Queen Sharmell. Tyrese Haliburton, the Indiana Pacers’ standout player, couldn’t quit fanboying over them at a recent game. He greeted them heartily and stated that he would like to take a photo with them after the game.</p><h2><span id=Booker_Ts_Wife_Meet_Sharmell_Huffman>Booker T’s Wife: Meet Sharmell Huffman</span></h2><p>Many wrestling fans are aware of Sharmell Huffman, Booker T’s wife, who used to compete in WWE. Sharmell, 53, began her career as a pageant queen before transitioning to wrestling. In the late 1990s, Sharmell met her husband, Booker T. As a member of the Nitro Girl dancing team, she had just begun her World Championship Wrestling career.</p><p>Nitro Girl’s popularity soared among wrestling fans, so she changed her stage name to Paisley and made her in-ring debut in 2000 against Tammy Lynn Sytch. In 2001, Sharmell became a full-time in-ring performer and backstage interviewer for the WWF. Her wrestling ambitions, however, were dashed when she suffered a serious knee injury.</p><p>However, he returned to the wrestling industry in 2005, this time with WWE. It was also the year she married Booker, and she was introduced as her husband’s valet when she entered the WWE. Shannon was a part of one of the WWE storylines that former WWE champion Kurt Angle feels was one of the worst.</p><p>Throughout the story, Kurt pursues Sharmell. Angle described it as the most humiliating story he had ever heard because he admired Booker and Sharmell. In 2006, Booker T was crowned “King Booker” after winning the King of the Ring Tournament, and Sharmell was christened “Queen Sharmell.”</p><p>The tandem left WWE in 2007 and made their TNA debut later that year. Sharmell announced her resignation from TNA after only two years. Sharmell has competed in wrestling matches as well as ventured into business with her husband, Booker. The wrestling duo established Reality of Wrestling in 2005. In 2022, Sharmell was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Between_Booker_T_and_His_Estranged_Son>Relationship Between Booker T. and His Estranged Son</span></h2><p>WWE wrestler Booker T has three children. He and his current wife, Sharmell Huffman, have two children. Brandon, Kendrick, and Kennedy are his three kids. Booker had a history of going to police stations before becoming a wrestling superstar and settling into his marriage with Sharmell.</p><p>He had previous relationships with other women before meeting Sharmell. Booker has a son named Brandon who he shares with Angela. Brandon was born in 1984, and after his release from prison in 1989, he sought custody of his son, who had been placed in foster care.</p><p>In a six-part series focusing on Booker’s personal life, Booker and Brandon previously discussed their turbulent relationship. Brandon then moved in with Booker and his aunt on occasion. The wrestler’s eldest son had a strained relationship with Booker’s first wife, Levestia, but has stated that he has a harmonious relationship with Sharmell.</p><h2><span id=Sharmell_and_Booker_T_Have_Twins>Sharmell and Booker T Have Twins</span></h2><p>After five years of marriage, Sharmell gave birth to twins Kendrick and Kennedy. The former wrestler has posted numerous family photos on her Instagram account. Sharmell celebrated their adolescence and entry into eighth grade earlier this year. Booker previously spoke with Helwani on The MMA Hour about his twins.</p><p>He stated that Kennedy and Kendrick both enjoy wrestling. He also mentioned that his son is in the battle room, listening to the angles, grasping what it means to the general, and taking command. Booker also stated that his daughter is ready to fight in the ring. He didn’t want his son to become a wrestler, so he wanted to teach him about business.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>WWE Wrestler</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Chelsee Healey No Makeup Look: Weight Loss And Plastic Surgery Before And After</a></h3>Chelsee Healey's makeup-free appearance has gained popularity, with many individuals copying her style.Healey is a popular TV personality and actress from Britain.
