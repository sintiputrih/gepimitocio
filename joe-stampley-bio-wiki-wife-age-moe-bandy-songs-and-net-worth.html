Despite the honky-tonk standards that both artists were famed for, most of the “Moe and Joe” collaborations were a tongue-in-cheek novelty and satiric songs. the first charting hit together, “Just Good Ol’ Boys”, became a #1 hit in Sept 1979 and was their most booming single.</p><p>The other hits were “Where’s the Dress”&nbsp; “Hey Moe, Hey Joe” (a cover of a single originally recorded by Carl Smith, with modified title and lyrics), and “Holding the Bag” . Later the latter was a satire on Boy George, and had an opening guitar riff similar to Culture Club’s #1 pop hit “Karma Chameleon”.</p><p>The song “Where’s The Dress” won the American Video Association’s award for Video of the Year in 1984. Afterward, Bandy and Stampley were recognized as the Country Music Association’s (CMA) 1980 Vocal Duo of the Year (as “Moe and Joe”) and won the Academy of Country Music’s Vocal Duo award for 2 consecutive years.</p><p>Stampley founded Critter Records. The 1st act signed to the label was Billy Hoffman in 2000. He sometimes performs in his native Springhill. Most of his music is available on CD from his official website. The New York Times Magazine listed Joe Stampley among 100 artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire on June 25, 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-stampley-songs></span><span>Joe Stampley Songs</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Just Good Ol’ Boys</li><li>I Cheated Me Right Out Of You</li><li>Hank Williams, You Wrote My Life</li><li>Bandy The Rodeo Clown</li><li>Where’s The Dress</li><li>Holding The Bag</li><li>Roll On Big Mama</li><li>Red Wine And Blue Memories</li><li>Do You Ever Fool Around</li><li>Hey Joe (Hey Moe)</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-stampley-roll-on-big-mama></span><span>Joe Stampley Roll On Big Mama</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Roll On Big Mama!</p><p>Roll on, (roll on) big mama<br>I like the way you sing<br>Roll on (roll on) big mama<br>The night time lets her breathe<br>Well, the feel of the wheel delivers me<br>From a life where I don’t wanna be and the diesel smoke<br>With every stroke sings a song with a heavy note</p><p>And ramblin is the life I chose<br>Sittin here between the doors<br>And the yellow line a keepin time<br>The things that’s a runnin through my mind<br>Through my mindRoll on (roll on) big mama<br>I like the way you roll<br>Roll on (roll on) big mama<br>You are my very soul</p><p>On through the snow and the drivin rain<br>To the forty-below in Bangor Maine<br>To the hundred-and-ten in the Texas sun<br>There ain’t no road that we ain’t run<br>Up through the Colarado mountain tops<br>Down to the desert where Reno stops<br>North to the green of Coeur D’ Alene<br>There ain’t no road that we ain’t seen<br>We ain’t seen</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-joe-stampley></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Joe Stampley</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-joe-stampley></span><span>Who is Joe Stampley?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joe Stampley is an American country music ethnic singer and songwriter well-known for being the 1960 main singer for the rock group; The Uniques.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-joe-stampley></span><span>How old is Joe Stampley?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Joe is 77 years old as of 2020, he was born on 6 June 1943, Springhill, Louisiana, United States.</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-joe-stampley></span><span>How tall is Joe Stampley?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joe stands at an average height, he has not shared his height with the public.
