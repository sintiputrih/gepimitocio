The&nbsp;Die Lit&nbsp;star gushed over Iggy, calling her a “great mom,” as he spoke about how excited he was for his son’s birthday. “I love her to death. I’m single. She’s single now. But that’s one of the best mothers in the world. And that’s what you got to put in the book, you hear me? I love her to death. She is the best mother in the world,” he said. At the end of the interview, he reiterated just how great of a mom Iggy is.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Iggy didn’t hold back and said that she felt like Playboi wasn’t being truthful in the interview. At one point, the Whole Lotta Red rapper spoke about paying bills for different people, including his “baby mom” and son. “I don’t f**k with a man I’m not even remotely on good terms with claiming he pays my bills. I pay my bills,” she wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Besides the bills comment, Iggy claimed that he doesn’t make similar kind comments to her in person. “Saying nice things for an interview sounds great, but in real life he talks to me like s**t so badly I had to stop all direct contact,” she tweeted. “I do appreciate being called a great mom but when that’s not reflective of what he has to say in real life, I’d much rather be left out of being mentioned at all.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Iggy-Azalea-and-Playboy-Carti-shade-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Iggy announced that she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gave birth</a> to Onyx in June 2020.
