He did not begin video blogging until several years after this. Later, he began creating YouTube videos in 2009 while trying to impress a girl with an interest in fellow YouTuber AmazingPhil. He began creating short videos about funny stories with his friends and family.</p><p>Cutforth began his career on YouTube on September 23, 2010. He started with a Q&A video and then went on to share challenges, storytimes, reaction-based videos, tags, Q&As, parodies, and general vlogs. Some of the most-watched videos of his channel are ‘The Whisper Challenge with Emma Blackery’, ‘How to be Pop Punk with Patty Walters’ and ‘Vegans: twenty-one pilots parody – Heathens’.</p><p>In one of his videos, he discussed the issue that his old account had been hacked and deleted. Since then, he has created content periodically and collaborated with many different YouTubers. Moreover, he has made many videos with fellow YouTubers like Emma Blackery, VeeOneEye and Phil Lester.</p><h4><span>More about his YouTube career</span></h4><p>His channel also has general vlogs featuring his friends and family members.

It features Cutforth’s trip to Barcelona with his friend Evan Edinger. Further, he changed the name of his channel from LukeIsNotSexy to Luke Cutforth to avoid advertising confusion with YouTube.</p><p>In 2007, he states he “began making films around the age of ten, when he was introduced to Digital Blue, the first camera used by Cutforth at a local youth club.” However, he had been making “little films” on his parents’ camera for years beforehand. He says that Digital Blue was his motivation to start experimenting with special effects and post-production.</p><h4><span>Film Directing</span></h4><p>He also used his YouTube profile to distribute short films to a wider audience than is otherwise possible. ‘In The House’ is a web horror series directed by Cutforth starring Charlotte Pearson which is set for a sequel later this year named ‘In The House 2: Back to the House’.</p><h4><span>For The One I Adore</span></h4><p>He was praised greatly for his short film about depression and love.

The video contains local actor Brogan Hume.</p><h4><span>Previous Work</span></h4><p>He was in the process of creating and directing a film that he co-wrote with friends, Ella Atcheson, Isla MacAskill, Amy Joseph, and recurring actor, Brogan Hume. The film, named “The Faces of Blood” was in Sheffield, and aimed to discuss the reactions of young people to an Apocalypse situation.</p><p>It follows the attempts of a set of young people presented with an “End of the world” scenario. And has been described as a cross between 28 Days Later and Cloverfield due to its Cinéma vérité style. However, the production of the film was canceled in 2010 after the deaths of Cutforth’s Grandfather and close friend.</p><p>He was once in discussions for a film called “The Snitch”, written by Joshua Hawkins. But was eventually unable to secure funding for the film due to certain controversial issues that the film raised, which investors thought may be seen as overly controversial, and so the production of the film was canceled.</p><h4><span>Planned Films</span></h4><p>During his time on “The Faces of Blood”, Cutforth also planned and wrote two other films. Even-though production details were never announced, Cutforth still seems keen to produce the films. The first of the planned films dealt with the depressive effects of Crohn’s disease It also shows how illnesses in the general can destroy people mentally, leading depression and occasionally suicide.</p><p>In July 2015, he announced he is working on a film based on the book titled “The Drowning of Arthur Braxton”, written by Caroline Smailes. He started a Kickstarter project and on September 2, the project successfully raised £84,434 with 4,118 backers, £9434 more than the required amount.</p><h4><span>Third-Party Projects</span></h4><p>He was involved in projects worldwide, including a memorial day video for the well-known game website Machinima.com.
