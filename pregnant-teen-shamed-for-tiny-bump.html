He is growing and moving every single day.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The college freshman, who lives in South Carolina, and is expecting a baby boy in April, claims her barely-there belly is the result of a healthy vegan diet, light cardio and yoga. She also chalks it up to genetics. “My mother was in a similar situation when she was pregnant,” she told Caters in an interview published Wednesday, January 3. “She was an athlete and she didn’t show until she was seven months pregnant. Although I’m much smaller than her, I believe being active has a part to play in the size of your bump.”&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reanna-stephens-tiny-baby-bump-ultrasound.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Though Stephens tells Us she has only gained five pounds —&nbsp;“it went to my breasts!” —<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>she has regular ultrasounds and her little boy is the perfect weight and length.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“The cruelest thing anyone has ever said to me was that I’m killing my baby,” she tells Us. “They said, ‘He’s going to die in your womb’ and that I’m not fit to have a baby.’ All my doctors say he is perfectly healthy.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>But Stephens knows she is doing everything right. “I’m going to be an amazing mom. I’m going to love and care for my child. I”ll fight for him and pray for him and be his support system,” she tells Us. “My baby boy will be the best thing that has ever happened to me.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Follow Stephens’ pregnancy journey on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602arnp2eYsCprcyem2aen6d6tbXNsmSbrZ2lfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./melissa-mccarthy-looks-thinner-than-ever-in-new-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Melissa McCarthy Looks Thinner Than Ever In New Photos</span></a>
