Likewise, we all know that parade participants wear elaborate masks, but did you know that it’s actually illegal to be on a parade float without wearing one?</p><p>And finally, of course, we all know Mardi Gras revelers drink — a lot — but few of us know all that much about the colorful world of Mardi Gras cocktails, a drinking culture just as rich, strange, and varied as the gumbo that is New Orleans itself.</p><p>Discover the photos, recipes, histories, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fun facts</a> behind the world of Mardi Gras cocktails below:</p><h2 class=title>Mardi Gras Cocktails: Hurricane</h2><img alt="Mardi Gras Cocktails Hurricane" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mardi-gras-cocktails-hurricane.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Perhaps the signature drink most representative of both Mardi Gras and New Orleans as a whole, the hurricane is a simple mix of rum, fruit juice, and syrup or grenadine.<p>The drink's name comes from the fact that it was originally (and still often is) served in glasses shaped like hurricane lamps (see above).</p></span><span class=credit><a href=#>Instagram</a></span><h2 class=title>Hurricane (continued)</h2><img alt="Hurricane Beads" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hurricane-beads.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>The hurricane was born when New Orleans tavern owner Pat O'Brien (whose bar still bears his name today) found a way to get rid of unpopular rum by mixing it with fruit juice and giving it away to sailors.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span><h2 class=title>Ramos Gin Fizz</h2><img alt="Ramos Gin Fizz Mardi Gras Cocktails" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ramos-gin-fizz-mardi-gras-cocktails.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>A classic New Orleans variation on the gin fizz, this cocktail adds orange flower water and egg white to the usual mix of gin, lemon and lime juices, sugar, cream, and soda water.<p>Largely because of that long ingredients list, the drink's inventor, Henry C. Ramos of New Orleans' Imperial Cabinet Saloon, was said to have 20 bartenders working simultaneously just to make Ramos fizzes, which took 12 minutes to mix per drink.</p></span><span class=credit><a

creation of Muriel's (at the heart of the French Quarter on Jackson Square), this cocktail combines cucumber vodka, lemon basil syrup, and balsamic cranberry gastrique.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Instagram</a></span><h2 class=title>Pimm's Cup</h2><img alt="Pimm's Cup" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pimms-cup.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Although this drink -- made from Pimm's liqueur, lemonade, 7Up, and cucmber -- was born in London, the version you'll find in New Orleans today was popularized by the French Quarter's famed Napoleon House.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span><h2 class=title>Hand Grenade</h2><img alt="Hand Grenade Cocktail" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hand-grenade-cocktail.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Probably the most distinctive (note its container), and certainly the most visibly marketed, of all Mardi Gras cocktails in recent years, this one nevertheless remains something of a mystery.<p>Since its invention in the Crescent City in the 1980s, its recipe has been kept secret, its licensing restricted to just five bars, and its impostors sought out and fined.</p><p>That said, you'll find varying recipes for "New Orleans' Most Powerful Drink" including some extremely potent mixtures of rum, vodka, and gin, along with an as-yet-unknown fruity liqueur.</p></span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span><h2 class=title>A Thousand Blue Eyes</h2><img alt="A Thousand Blue Eyes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/a-thousand-blue-eyes.jpg> <span class=caption-body>This relatively new addition to the New Orleans cocktail tradition fittingly comes from a relatively new bar: Cure.<p>The recipe contains gin, vermouth, lemon juice, orange flower water, simple syrup, and bitters.</p></span><span class=credit><a

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/arnauds-special-cocktail.jpg> <span class=caption-body>This mixture of scotch, aromatized wine, and orange bitters was invented at New Orleans' famed Arnaud's restaurant in the 1940s and has remained popular to this day.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span><h2 class=title>Frozen Grasshopper</h2><img alt="Frozen Grasshopper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/frozen-grasshopper.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Featuring creme de menthe, creme de cacao, and vanilla ice cream, this is yet another refreshing concoction to have unsurprisingly taken hold in the often-sweltering New Orleans climate.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Instagram</a></span><h2 class=title>Mardi Gras Cocktails: El Diablo</h2><img alt="El Diablo Cocktail" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/el-diablo-cocktail.jpg> <span class=caption-body>New Orleans isn't just famous for inventing plenty of wholly unique drinks, it's also earned a reputation for creating compelling twists on tried-and-true cocktails.<p>While plenty of cocktails bear the name el diablo (and are largely tequila-based), this drink from Muriel's combines rum, lime, and ginger syrup with a cayenne and sugar rim.</p></span><span class=credit><a href=#>Instagram</a></span><h2 class=title>Mississippi Mud Coffee</h2><img alt="Mississippi Mud Coffee" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mississippi-mud-coffee.jpg> <span class=caption-body>While most signature New Orleans cocktails are of a light, refreshing nature, the Mississippi Mud Coffee stands in stark contrast.<p>This heavy, rich cocktail combines coffee, whiskey, creme de cacao, and cacao simple syrup.</p></span><span class=credit><a href=#>Instagram</a></span><h2 class=title>Brandy Milk Punch</h2><img alt="Brandy Milk Punch" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/brandy-milk-punch.jpg> <span class=caption-body>One other cocktail from the rich and heavy camp, the brandy milk punch is a staple of New Orleans drinking during the holiday season, but certainly carries over through Mardi Gras.<p>This brunch favorite includes brandy, milk, sugar, ice, and nutmeg.</p></span><span class=credit><a href=#>Instagram</a></span><h2 class=title>Cajun Bloody Mary</h2><img alt="Cajun Bloody Mary" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cajun-bloody-mary.jpg> <span class=caption-body>This unique twist on another brunch staple, the classic bloody mary, adds New Orleans cajun flavor in the form of creole seasoning and pickled green beans or okra.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span><h2 class=title>Irish Spring</h2><img alt="Irish Spring Cocktail" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/irish-spring-cocktail.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Given its refreshing qualities, mint finds its way into a number of cocktails popular in New Orleans, including the Irish spring, made with mint-tea simple syrup, ginger beer, lemon juice, and whiskey.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Instagram</a></span><h2 class=title>Absinthe</h2><img alt="Absinthe Flame" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/absinthe-flame.jpg> <span class=caption-body>After a long, controversial ban, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">absinthe</a> once again became legal in the United States in 2007, and has since gained popularity across the country.<p>However, given the spirit's extraordinary popularity in France, and New Orleans' French roots, it's no surprise that absinthe has taken especially deep hold in the Crescent City.</p><p>While not technically a cocktail, the preparation that goes into making the drink — as shown above, sugar is caramelized on a special spoon before being mixed with the absinthe — earns it a spot on this list.</p></span><span class=credit><a href=#>Instagram</a></span><h2 class=title>Green Beast</h2><img alt="Green Beast" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/green-beast.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Like so many New Orleans cocktails, this absinthe-based concoction includes a refreshing blend of cucumber and lime.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span><h2 class=title>French 75</h2><img alt="French 75" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/french-75.jpg> <span class=caption-body>While not born in New Orleans, the French 75 is another cocktail that has retained a unique popularity there due to its French roots.<p>Supposedly invented at the famed New York Bar in Paris during World War I, this mixture of gin, champagne, simple syrup, and lemon juice gets its name from the fact that it reportedly kicked as hard as a French 75mm field gun.</p></span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span><h2 class=title>Vieux Carre</h2><img alt="Vieux Carre" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/vieux-carre.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Despite its French name, this one was actually invented in New Orleans at the legendary Carousel Bar during the 1930s.<p>The recipe combines rye, cognac, vermouth, Bénédictine herbal liqueur, and bitters.</p></span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span><h2 class=title>Summer Thyme Blues</h2><img alt="Summer Thyme Blues" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/summer-thyme-blues.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Another creation of Muriel's, this peerlessly fruity cocktail combines blueberry thyme syrup with lemon juice, bourbon, and violet liqueur. </span><span class=credit><a href=#>Instagram</a></span><h2 class=title>Honey Child</h2><img alt="Honey Child Cocktail" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/honey-child-cocktail.jpg> <span class=caption-body>One more from Muriel's, this similarly fruity drink brings together blackberries, basil, black raspberry liqueur, and honeysuckle vodka.</span><span class=credit><a

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sazerac.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Along with the hurricane, another strong candidate for the signature New Orleans drink, the Sazerac has actually been named the city' official drink by the Louisiana legislature.<p>Perhaps even more interestingly, this simple blend of cognac, absinthe, and bitters has been described by some as America's oldest cocktail.</p></span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span><h2 class=title>King Cake Cocktail</h2><img alt="King Cake Cocktail
