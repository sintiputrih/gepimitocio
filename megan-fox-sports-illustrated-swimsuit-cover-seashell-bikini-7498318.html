Of course, it's not an&nbsp;SI&nbsp;cover without a wanderlust-inducing locale. Fox posed on the shores of the Dominican Republic for this year's spread in picks from JÉBLANC, Frankies Bikinis, and Miaou. She was also styled in jewels from Jacquie Aiche, LETRA, and Ryan Storer, and her raven hair — perfected by her hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dimitris Giannetos</a> — was worn in butt-length beach waves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a statement, MJ Day,&nbsp;SI Swimsuit's editor in chief, said that the selection of models was meant to provoke conversation (and give everyone a packing list for their summer getaways). Day called Fox a "superwoman with superpowers," breaking outdated ideas of what it means to be a Hollywood bombshell.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Taylor Hill/FilmMagic</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Martha Stewart is a legend. The definition of a great female entrepreneur who built a dynasty against insurmountable odds. Megan Fox is a superwoman with superpowers. She’s intelligent, boundary-breaking and strong, fighting against the constant objectification she’s endured from the industry. Kim Petras is an inspiration to us all. As a Grammy-winning singer-songwriter, a beacon of inspiration for the trans and LGBTQ+ community, she empowers and encourages her followers simply through her talent and perseverance. And Brooks Nader, who started her modeling career through our Swim Search program, has been such an amazing part of our brand and has proven to the world through her hard work and dedication that she is a force to be reckoned with. These women, alongside our other models, refuse to allow themselves to be limited by existing societal norms and are incredible examples on how to harness talent, passion, persistence, perseverance, fortitude, curiosity and unabashed desire to evolve.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The 2023 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue arrives on newsstands May 18.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJ6emqZdm7y5edKppquso2K2rbjUrKurmaSasW6%2F1qKkrK2ZqXqku9WeqWarlZbAqbHLpWSboZueu6p5lm1wcWthbQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hoodrich-pablo.html><span>←</span><span>Hoodrich Pablo Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
