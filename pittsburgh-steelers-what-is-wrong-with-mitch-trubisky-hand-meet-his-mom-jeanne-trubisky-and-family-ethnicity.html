In 2022, Trubisky signed a free-agent contract with the Steelers.</p><p>Mitch started as a quarterback against the Cincinnati Bengals. In the narrowly escaped victory, Trubisky seemed inconsistent, which led many fans to believe that there was something wrong with Mitch Trubisky hand.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pittsburgh-steelers-what-is-wrong-with-mitch-trubisky-hand></span>Pittsburgh Steelers: What Is Wrong With Mitch Trubisky Hand?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There are no excuses moving forward with the game. As so, there is nothing wrong with Mitch Trubisky hand.&nbsp;</p><p>The Steelers’ offense seems to be using a playbook used last year. They frequently allow Trubisky to move the ball down the field, even if it is only on the edges, and they also let him leave the pocket.</p><p>Some speculation even suggests that Trubisky should sit on the bench in 12-month leagues until the play-calling becomes more quarterback-friendly and the offensive line starts to perform better.</p><p>Although Mitch Trubisky showed some promise and occasionally made good use of his mobility, he was often too inconsistent. He needs to play quarterback better for the squad, or the cries for youngster Kenny Pickett will soon take over.</p><p>In addition, while acknowledging that the Steelers avoided the turnovers that plagued the Bengals, Mitch Trubisky emphasized that the Steelers’ offense needs to do more to seize the opportunities presented to them.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong>Is Kyler Murray Christian?
