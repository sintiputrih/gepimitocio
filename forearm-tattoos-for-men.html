Usually, it’s the name of a loved one who has passed away, and the inking of their name allows the wearer to always keep them near. But a name tattoo doesn’t always need to have such a somber story behind it. It can be used simply to honour a loved partner or your children.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-religious-forearm-tattoo><span id=6_Religious_Forearm_Tattoo>6.

An arrow tattoo fits the shape and contours of your forearm perfectly so it’s one of the best designs to choose for it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-abstract-forearm-tattoo><span id=9_Abstract_Forearm_Tattoo>9.

If you have a favorite that is of particular significance to you, consider it for your next tattoo. The forearm is a great location for a quote tattoo because it stretches wide enough to fit at least two lines of text that will be large enough to read clearly.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-11-flower-forearm-tattoo><span id=11_Flower_Forearm_Tattoo>11.

If you’re a bad boy at heart then you’ll be naturally drawn to this image. Skulls aren’t all just about death and destruction though — they can be quite symbolic and tackle deep existential themes such as the unachievable nature of immortality.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-13-tree-forearm-tattoo><span id=13_Tree_Forearm_Tattoo>13. Tree Forearm Tattoo</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pulptastic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/13.tree-branch.forearm-tattoo.jpeg><p>Trees symbolize life and growth.

They are best tattooed on the shoulder, upper arm and back. The forearm isn’t the best place for an isolated wing tattoo piece. However, if you can integrate it into a larger piece that spans the aforementioned areas, then it could have some serious potential.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-15-angel-forearm-tattoo><span id=15_Angel_Forearm_Tattoo>15.
