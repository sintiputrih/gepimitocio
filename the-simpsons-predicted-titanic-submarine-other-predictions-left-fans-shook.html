on the disaster.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>Mike Reiss talks missing Titanic vessel</figure><p id=epPz8TCvJJU data-wc=42>While praising the vehicle for its construction, he admitted in a <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">BBC Breakfast</a> interview on Monday: "If it's down at the bottom, I don't know how anyone is going to be able to access it, much less bring it back up."</p><p id=eM-ebln4WsR data-wc=27>As tin foil hat moments abound, here are some of the other craziest gazes into the future made by The Simpsons over its nearly 34-year long run.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Donald Trump's Presidency</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1070eb0c33c8-donald-trump-presidency.jpg><p id=exh_MvbrOkH data-wc=50>Yes, the animated Nostradamus predicted one of the most divisive presidential runs in American history, with a throwaway gag in a 2000 episode called 'Bart to the Future,' in which he travels to where his sister Lisa is now POTUS and talks of repairing the economy after <a class=hm-link href=#>Donald Trump's</a> presidency.</p><p id=eTdcFhEXZE data-wc=14><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Donald Trump found liable of sexually abusing and forcibly touching E Jean Carroll</a></p><p id=edgcqLryVY- data-wc=41>A still from the episode even features Homer descending an escalator alongside Trump while his supporters cheer him on, an eerie parallel to a similar scene from his campaign trail for the real life 2016 election, this time alongside wife Melania.</p><h2 dir=ltr>The COVID-19 Pandemic</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4bc11b130cb5-covid-19-pandemic.jpg><p id=eAMike-dOtb data-wc=45>We may have all watched too much of 2011's Contagion during the lockdown, but back in the 1993 Simpsons episode 'Marge in Chains,' we found a much earlier allusion to the pandemic, when the fictional world is ravaged by a disease called "the Osaka Flu."</p><p id=eN8yxRIiJ9 data-wc=14><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Shocking details from inside OceanGate submersible revealed as it meets 96-hour oxygen limit</a></p><p id=ef_FbdKXrZs data-wc=40>Similar to the 2020 treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists immediately advised residents of Springfield to remain at home while they found a cure to the virus, which also happened to originate in another country before making its way Stateside.</p><h2 dir=ltr>The Walt Disney and Fox Merger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b2413683bc51-walt-disney-fox-merger.jpg><p id=e7uryLcZrbW data-wc=59>In a bit of poking fun at the hand that feeds you, in a 1998 episode titled 'When You Wish Upon a Star,' Homer decides to collaborate with 20th Century Fox and even makes a suggestion to Fox executives, which cuts to the new 20th Century Fox logo with the words "A Division of Walt Disney Co" inscribed below.&nbsp;</p><p id=e2KITQCNOR data-wc=17><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>You can now live in Walt Disney's California mansion, but the price is eye-watering – photos</a></p><p id=e4P5bUfXDTMX data-wc=41>That particular prediction hit quite close to home, though, as in 2019, Disney and 21st Century Fox settled on a historic merger amounting to $71 billion, meaning the Fox-owned animated series had found themselves a new home of their own choosing.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Lady Gaga at The Super Bowl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

'Lisa Goes Gaga,' Lisa meets <a class=hm-link href=#>Lady Gaga</a> herself, who then delights the residents of Springfield with a concert featuring pyrotechnics, elaborate costumes, a harness lifting her above the crowd, and a moment on the piano.</p><p id=eVSNruC295 data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Lady Gaga channels Marilyn Monroe, Madonna in stunning figure-hugging new look</a></p><p id=eCLxGPuqa1GK data-wc=45>Cut to 2017, when Gaga performed at the 2017 Super Bowl LI Halftime Show, where she broke out some pyrotechnics, elaborate costumes, was lifted above the crowd in a harness, and performed the ballad 'Million Reasons' on the piano. It really was a perfect illusion.</p><h2 dir=ltr>The Covering Up of Michelangelo's David</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1592d5112383-michelangelo-david.jpg><p id=eai_sG8avJLi data-wc=59>In a 1990 episode titled 'Itchy & Scratchy & Marge,' Marge learns a hard lesson on censorship when her demand to crack down on violence in TV ends up backfiring when the famously nude Michelangelo's David makes a stop in Springfield and residents demand it be covered up, resulting in the statue being dressed in a pair of jeans.</p><p id=e2NhCiyyEXsn data-wc=48>The debate over nudity as a form of art was brought up once again almost three decades later in the real world, when some citizens of St. Petersburg, Russia demanded that a copy of the statue displayed in the city be covered up (though not in jeans, thankfully).</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
