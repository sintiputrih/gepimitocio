Needless to say, that kind of following pays pretty well.</p><p>Joel and his wife, Victoria, have <a href=#>been criticized</a> in the past over their extravagant lifestyle and <a href=#>multiple houses</a>, but the 57-year-old has no problem defending <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his wealth</a>, which was recently estimated at $100 million.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joel Osteen owns two houses in Houston.</h2><p>The minister was born and raised in Texas’ largest city, where his father, John Osteen, founded Lakewood in 1959. His palatial estate sits in the affluent community of River Oaks, and the 17,000-square-foot residence features six bedrooms, six bathrooms, three elevators, a one-bedroom guest house, and a pool house.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Google Earth</span></figure><p>The best-selling author and his wife of over three decades <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly paid</a> $10.5 million in 2010 for the property, which sits on 1.86 acres. The couple kept their previous home — a 5,600-square-foot mansion valued at $2.9 million — in the Tanglewood neighborhood, but sold off a vacant half-acre lot next to the house for $1.1 million.</p><p>In a 2012 interview on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oprah’s Next Chapter</a>, Joel explained that he tries to be the opposite of what most people think when they hear the word televangelist. "It’s a battle we have to fight. But it’s interesting how… people usually know who’s sincere and who’s not over time," he shared.</p><p>"We don’t ask for money and people send in millions of dollars to help us keep the broadcast on the air and so, it’s an interesting thing," he added.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Most of Joel and Victoria Osteen's money comes from book deals.</h2><p>The pair has written at least 18 different books, some on their own and some together. "We don’t take a salary from the ministry," Joel said of himself and Victoria, who serves as Lakewood’s co-senior pastor.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"About five years ago, when I wrote my first book ["Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential"], I mean, I never dreamed it would sell millions of copies," the father of two told Oprah. "[The wealth] comes from that."</p><p>When asked if he ever feels the need to apologize for his expensive taste, Joel responded, "I really don’t… We just feel like this is God’s blessings.</p><p>"You know, we’re big givers," the TV personality continued. "We live what we preach. We’ve given millions of dollars and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with having a nice place to live and being blessed. Money should never be the focus of your life. If that’s all you’re doing, that’s shallow. It should be to be a blessing to others."</p><p>Joel’s influence recently netted him some pretty big guest stars for his remote Easter service on April 12. Kanye West, Mariah Carey, and Tyler Perry will make appearances during the pre-recorded program.&nbsp;</p><p>"It just all came together," the preacher told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> of the upcoming event. "I don’t know that I did it too much, but it just kind of fell into place."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7ymuIyoqq2dlaN6qbvUrJys</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./giorgio-tsoukalos-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Giorgio Tsoukalos Net Worth 2024</span></a>
