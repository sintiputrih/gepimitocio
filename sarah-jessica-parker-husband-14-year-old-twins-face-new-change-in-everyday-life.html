"It’s so awake! It’s amazing. There are so many spots to be, and to sit and to meet. And it’s so much more diverse than New York. To see a city where there is so much color and variety mixing on the street for real? It’s unbelievable. It all feels so much more integrated than our city. Here, you can go to the National Theatre and see people of all nationalities in the audience."&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eo-RtDdv9l data-wc=49>On Instagram, she would post snapshots of her walks around the city, writing in one caption: "Walking around. London. It’s nice seeing new things. Reading new things. Signs. Even directions. Finding our shops. Learning the Tube. The buses. Which one gets me where I need to go.
