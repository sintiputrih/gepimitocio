They were looking for his fiancée’s son because he argued with another teenager at Brooklyn Park Middle School earlier that day. When Wright told them that the boy didn’t want to fight, they insisted that Wright should fight them instead.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chris-696x392.jpg><p>Later on, more of the teen’s friends came to Wright’s house, trying to find the 14-year-old. This led to a struggle between them and resulted in Wright’s death. According to reports, all three of his fiancée’s children were at home when Christopher Wright passed away. Christopher Wright died around 5 pm, and he was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead at 9:45 pm on Saturday. A fundraiser has been organized by Shanna Tetrick and Kristin Karopchinsky with the goal of raising $50,000.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunCvx6ugrKyfpbWmvoymoJygkZq5bsPRop6hrF2rtqWxzmafqK9dmbaleceeZJ2hlWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cade-holt.html><span>←</span><span>Cade Holt</span></a>
